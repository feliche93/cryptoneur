Our mission is to elevate craft, knowledge, and ideas worldwide and help pseudonymous talent connect through their work. We design our product with the philosophy — “what we do shapes who we are.” The fragmented workflow, insular entities, and inconsistent branding make it difficult for people to onboard, engage, and contribute to projects at scale. As a result, projects in Defi suffer from operational inefficiency, lack of diversity, and low contributor retention. \n\nSTATION is tackling these issues by creating IDs for individuals to express their work and discover others and Terminals for organizations (DAOs and protocols) to build a central hub to attract and engage newcomers and contributors.

This could be the first DeFi product thoroughly decentralized both on the protocol and the app layers.\n\nWe have been using Aave protocol and would love for Aave to have a decentralized app. So many young users and crypto first-timers could enjoy using Aave on their phone. We think timing is perfect for building a mobile app for the most popular and secure DeFi protocol, Aave. L2 solutions are getting launched in the coming months and the cost of interactions with ethereum blockchain and Aave protocol will make more sense for mainstream users. After 1st release and when Aave is available on L2, we plan to adopt L2 in the app accordingly.",

While Dune Analytics has served as an effective platform for the crypto community, the ease-of-use it provides comes at the cost of some flexibility in terms of the depth and quality of analysis. Because the interface is UI driven, certain options for visualization and analysis are less practical than a more custom-designed solution.  Furthermore, backend changes to the data can generate errors within previously published dashboards which can cause confusion for those trying to glean insights from the graphs. With that in mind, our project is about building an Aave dashboard, built on top of the language R, which builds on the current Dune Analytics version with more functionality, automation, and speed. Our custom-designed solution will be built upon the Covalent API, ensuring that the results and analytics are updated dynamically. Because R is our backend, a suite of statistical software is at our disposal for extending the current set of dashboard outputs, including things like growth forecasts, customer attrition, and customer segmentation.

It will be a 1 month long meme contest with 4 phases, each phase will have a different theme, themes will be based on what feature of AAVE we want to raise awareness about.  Each phase will last for a week. We will come up with relevant hashtags for participants to use which should raise awareness about the project. Each phase top 3 memes will receive prizes, Winners will be picked by judges. Judges will be members from aave grants dao and I. Number of likes and retweets a post has will be irrelevant. I will setup a tipping bot on the AAVE discord server that won't require having to spend gas fee on each transaction. I also suggest setting up an AAVE meme twitter account.",

During meta-delegate meetings, students from around the globe come together to present, discuss, and debate new and existing Aave proposals. Afterwards, every university in our network gets to vote on the proposal, and the BEN meta-delegate casts its official vote in the direction of the majority in the official Aave governance process. This way, BEN can bring representation and engagement from smaller universities who may not have the time or resources to operate their own delegates.\n\nWe recently received 2.5m in UNI voting power from a16z to use for our Uniswap meta-delegate. Since then, BEN’s Uniswap Meta-Delegate has gone on to participate in the recently passed Arbitrum deployment proposal and the Uniswap lowering threshold proposal. We pushed an internal vote to over 40+ student representatives from various universities across the globe and then cast the official meta-delegate vote in the Uniswap according to the internal result. This initiative has not only showcased effective decentralized governance execution but also demonstrated how a community that rallies together can have their voice be heard hundredfold. \n\nAdditionally, we have been hosting events and workshops to teach our university chapters how to run their own Uniswap delegates. We hosted the first such event in February (https://events.decentraland.org/en/?event=4091122c-0201-4361-aef0-ee4e64f429e0) with two of our chapters who had already set up delegates, Blockchain at Berkeley and Harvard Law School Blockchain & Fintech Initiatives, as presenters. We built connections with a16z and Uniswap to connect them with clubs who have the interest and capacity to be Uniswap delegates but need assistance in voting power or guidance in understanding what it means to be a delegate for a community-run DeFi project.\n\nPer the success of our Uniswap Meta-Delegate, we believe we can emulate the same levels of achievement hundredfold by establishing an Aave Meta-Delegate. We aim to expand our governance initiatives across a variety of protocols in an attempt to expose our members to the opportunity of governance participation while enabling their abilty to amplify their voices as a collective whole. \n",

DAOs are cutting-edge organizational structures, and there is very limited precedent to help DAO stakeholders understand how to operate, particularly when it comes to legal compliance. These organizations are now starting to research legal, governance, diversity, treasury management, tax, and other issues, but much of the foundational learnings and research of DAO stakeholders are siloed within their own communities. \n\nThe DAO Research Cooperative accelerates DAO functionality by procuring and open-sourcing research foundational to effective DAO operation. The cooperative will be composed of multiple DAO members, which leverage group buying power, collectively make decisions, and provide insight about the most important information to acquire. \n\nI am currently raising a small amount of funding for an MVP DAO Research Cooperative, which will pay for open-source research on a small number of the most pressing issues for DAOs, prioritized based on feedback from DAO stakeholders. The MVP will demonstrate the value of the cooperative structure and, in future, I intend to build a sustainable DAO Research Cooperative to support members on an ongoing basis.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nDAOs are cutting-edge organizational structures and there is very limited precedent to help members understand how to operate their DAOs. These organizations are now starting to research legal, governance, treasury management, tax, diversity, and other issues, but much of the foundational learnings and research of DAO stakeholders are siloed within their own communities.  \n\nTaking legal as an example, many DAO communities are currently trying to figure out how they can take basic actions - like hiring contractors, diversifying treasuries, and paying taxes - while complying with the law. The decentralized governance and operation of a DAO adds another layer of complexity to running legal analyses, and implementing those analyses. \n\nFor instance, where a DAO is controlled through a governance token, members may have to vote on releasing treasury funding to pay lawyers or other experts for an analysis. They will also, most likely, have to choose an entity or individual to run that process and work with the expert to receive advice. Working on such an analysis typically requires extensive iteration and client feedback, which is complicated and slow if that feedback comes from a decentralized entity. See the I co-authored with Jesse Walden for a specific example of such an issue and the difficulty of scaling while decentralizing decision-making: https://variant.fund/leadership-in-the-ownership-economy/.\n\nWhile the DAO Research Cooperative would not obtain sensitive legal advice on behalf of its members (e.g. analysis of the legality of DAOs hiring executives without a legal entity), it would fund research that forms the foundation of that analysis (e.g. analysis of precedent for unincorporated organizations hiring contractors). \n\nSOLUTION\n\nThe DAO Research Cooperative accelerates DAO functionality by procuring and open-sourcing research foundational to effective DAO operation. \n\nI am currently requesting limited funding for an MVP cooperative that would purchase information on a subset of the most pressing issues for DAOs, prioritized based on feedback from DAO stakeholders. \n\nAfter completing this MVP, I intend to establish a sustainable organization that can purchase information for DAOs on an ongoing basis. This organization would coordinate and incentivize relevant DAO research, and aims to greatly accelerate the development of foundational DAO research. The sustainable cooperative would ideally research, curate, and open-source all research compiled for its DAO members, ultimately providing a centre of excellence for DAO operation.\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nFor our MVP, we will receive grants from multiple DAOs and foundations to fund a subset of the most pressing research topics for DAOs. The more members and funding available, the more research the cooperative can source. \n\nTo save on expense and logistics, the MVP will not have a formal cooperative structure, and the funding for research will be held and distributed by Statler Inc.\n\nAfter determining the issues most pressing to DAOs, based on feedback received from members, the cooperative will engage subject-matter experts to draft white papers addressing those topics. Subject-matter experts could include academics, developers, lawyers, economists, etc.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of some strong candidates for early membership: Aave, Balancer, Compound, Maker, Nexus Mutual, and Uniswap.\n\nOnce we’ve completed the MVP, we’ll apply learnings to determine structure and budget for a sustainable organization. The cooperative will apply directly to DAO treasuries for larger grants to build a sustainable organization that can work to purchase research for DAOs on an ongoing basis. \n",

Zapper, debank, zerion, etc. do a good job of suiting retail users' needs (quick glance of total wallet holdings across protocols). But they don't cut it for the level of risk, PnL, and compliance information that institutional users need.\n\nWe submitted a proposal a few weeks ago to see if a grant would be a good fit for our Aave integration. Unfortunately we didn't receive approval, however we've decided to create and implement the first iteration we described. (See demo at https://merv.tech/aave/positions/demo)\n\nThese are the components we've created so far:\n- user can input any compatible ethereum or polygon address for Aave V2 and Aave Polygon\n- user's overview in currency: total amount lending, borrowing, collat., avail. borrow, health, incentive rewards, and stk. rewards\n- table and most recent standings of user's open positions, for each position: amount lended/borrowed in currency and tokens, is collateral lend / is var or stable borrow, lend apy / var apy or stable apy, 7d lend apy / 7d var apy\n- historical chart breakdowns by market for each open and closed user position: time vs. token lended/borrowed amount, adjustable by timeframe. from what we can tell, we have the highest fidelity and most accurate historical charts for Aave positions available right now - users can see changes in their lend/borrow balance by the hour dating back from when they first opened that market position.\n\nAnd here are the specs of the components we want to create and add:\n- integration of all 3rd party wallet providers\n- batching of multiple user addresses\n- convert currency amounts for positions to any user selected major currency\n- overview of total token amount gained by lending and interest accrued by borrowing\n- expand historical chart breakdowns to include: time vs. amount in X currency, time vs. AAVE rewards, time vs. AAVE rewards in X currency, time vs. lended TVL for market, time vs. lend/ var borrow APY\n- export all positions data into an \"Aave Income Statement\" for each month, quarter, or selected timeframe\n- export all individual historical positions .csv; similar to how you would export a list of all trades from an exchange\n- alerts on position triggers with notifications (sms, email)\n- anything else? tell us!",

More information on our docs website. \n\nNevermined provides a protocol for defining different types of Service Agreements allowing to implement different use cases between parties. In this case, we want to integrate Nevermined with Aave allowing third party DApps to use their NFTs as collateral in their marketplaces. \n\nThis implementation would allow these marketplaces to augment their existing functionality for their communities allowing loans using NFTs as collateral. This functionality will be offered as a library for these marketplaces, providing new functionalities without lower level integrations with Nevermined or Aave. This would allow a frictionless integration, and at the same time bringing utility and users to Nevermined and Aave.\n\nInternally to that library, the agreements are settled on the Nevermined protocol, the users (delegator and delegatee) create an agreement where the delegator puts some collateral on Aave on behalf of the delegate, using the credit delegation functionalities, and the delegate provides a NFT as collateral for this agreement. If the agreement is fulfilled correctly on maturity date, the delegate can withdraw the NFT, in other case, delegator will get the NFT as liquidation penalty. \n\nSome more analysis of the use case can be found in this initial document:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1izY_NrrbTn1NUS6nXjHfpR5_ZK24cIAUk6FJud0aSgE/edit?usp=sharing\n",

This rings even more true in the case of oracles that secure billions of dollars of value.\n\nWe want to offer Aave the ability to provide their users with extra comfort when transacting with their platform by enabling them to visualise a protocol's oracle security.\n\nWe have built a data aggregation pipeline and visualisation tool. Our software collects raw data from blockchains and displays it in an intuitive layout. For the past few months, we have been focused on Chainlink network data, but we are expanding our scope. Our data and algorithm ranks oracles based on their objective performance. The data that is collected is contextualised through a frontend interface. The interface unpacks the holistic end-to-end smart contract ecosystem. It visualises the API providers, oracles, reference data contracts and the smart contract applications.\n\nWe are providing a data visualisation service. Users are able to visualise data in our UI or on their own. We are committed to transparency and reputation and have a free beta API. Anyone will be able to use our platform to create reputation algorithms. They will also be able to aggregate and display the various on-chain metrics we collect.\n\nWe would like to integrate with you. Once integrated, all of the Aave and Chainlink oracle data will be available on our website. We will then be able to easily support Aave with our our upcoming features which will be very valuable for your users.",

Using FailSafe DAO's can entrust relatively anonymous groups of people with managing large sums of money with the security of being able to revoke permissions and cancel spending at anytime. \n\nFailSafe is a kind of optimistic execution that allows Gnosis Multisig committees to make spend decisions at their own pace, where an administrator (an individual, token holder governance, or another multisig) has the option to override a fund payout or execution before it occurs. \n\nThe FailSafe tool runs inside the Gnosis Safe App, and allows multisigs to work using their normal workflow so there are no changes or new environments necessary for existing multisig working groups. FailSafe is flexible and extensible and can be used with any number of administrators and users. \n",

But we have also built this program in such a way that anyone and everyone can take part in it, and earn crypto rewards for just participating with a valid submission. \n\nThe blockchain and web3 space have been expanding quickly every day, and yet not many know how to use Web3 products and services. Most people already know or have heard about cryptocurrencies but have only considered it or have learned about them as a speculative trading asset, rather than something with actual utility.\n\nTo bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2, and to provide an easy and understandable way for beginners to onboard onto Web3 and discover its amazing use cases, we have taken up the initiative to start a small incentivized learning experiment to get you started.\n\nHow this works is that we will provide you a list of basic and simple tasks, which you will need to complete. These tasks were created to easily onboard you to Web3, and get you started in using decentralized tools, services, and applications. Upon completing these tasks you will need to create some sort of content related to the tasks you had to do. This content could be anything, it could be you talking about your experience using these tools, what new things you have learned by doing these tasks, you could do a bit more research and create some content that talks about how these tools and applications work in the behind the scenes, or you could even create your own version of this tutorial/walkthrough with your additional touch, maybe in your local language.\n\nWe had initially designed UNCRYPTD where we reward everyone who participates. We received a small Polygon Grant of  500 MATIC and some selfless donations from friends.  We currently have a prize pool of up to 552 MATIC, but we look to potentially increase this reward, and also to create a 2nd edition for this. \n\nWith the current prize money of 552 MATIC this is how we have structured the event: \nThere will be 2 rounds - Round 1 (Open to Everyone) & Round 2 (Open to selected candidates from Round 1).\n50% - to all participants ⇒ **276 MATIC** to be distributed among **all participants**\n\n25% - to Round 2 participants ⇒ **138 MATIC** to be distributed among **qualified participants**\n\n25% - to GRAND PRIZE WINNER(s) ⇒ **138 MATIC**  to **WINNER(s).**\n\nRound 1 tasks involved users installing Metamask, connecting Metamask to Polygon, getting some free MATIC from matic.supply to use as gas ( or any alternative faucet), and minting your first NFT using the Polygon NFT minter and then create content during Round 1. \n\nas Round 1 introduced NFTs, Round 2 introduces DeFi.\nRound 2 would involve users doing various actions on Polygon network's Defi ecosystem, such as Depositing and Borrowing on AAVE, swapping on Sushiswap, adding LP positions, etc.  We may go with a track-based approach with Round 2. The exact details are still being discussed.",

The beta version of Forta's public alert registry can be found at https://explorer.forta.network/. \n\nDeFi projects that co-sponsor the hackathon can provide a list of agent ideas they want developers to build.

Linen is using the concept of “guardians” pioneered by Argent for the multi-chain approach. Not having a seed phrase lowers barriers to entry for less technical users and provides more security compared to wallets that use seed phrases (EOA). Linen uses Gnosis-Safe smart contracts. It is currently implemented on Ethereum mainnet and will be launching on Polygon (closed beta testing now) together with other L1 and L2 chains. \n\nLinen is allocating a budget (marketing + user prizes) to properly launch its Polygon integration and to highlight Polygon Dapps to its users/investors.\n\nBacked by Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, HashKey, and other VCs, Linen also recently raised $4.9M from 5,000 community members via a regulated offering on Republic (https://republic.co/linen). Almost all Linen investors are crypto users.  \n\nThe launch of Linen on Polygon will feature a contest with cash and generative art NFT prizes. NFTs are branded for each community that participates in this launch. Here is a sample of what an NFT may look like for the Aave community: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fXRzI8TfI0XZzHHmiF1iSSrYf_lpmCFQ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nEach community participating in the launch will have 20 or 50 (TBD) variations of the communities’ generative art NFT. The current theme for the whole collection is Antique Gods as per the sample above. We anticipate that there will be 10-15 communities that Linen invites to participate in the Linen launch on Polygon. The whole collection will have ~1,000 unique NFT pieces. The generative algorithm for the NFTs will use a winning referral code (for example) as a seed to generate a unique piece for each winner of the contest.  \n\nWe would like to invite Aave to become one of the launch partners of Linen on Polygon. Linen would produce a set of NFTs attributed to the Aave community and include them in the winning package and produce educational content for Linen users about the Aave protocol and distribute it among contest participants.

The goal of Forta is to detect threats and other system critical issues as soon as possible. By providing users with timely and useful information about the security and stability of their systems, they have an opportunity to react and take defensive action, preventing or minimizing loss of funds.  \n\nThe Forta Network has two main components - agents and nodes. Agents are pieces of logic (scripts) that look for certain transaction characteristics or state changes on smart contracts across any Layer 1, Layer 2, or sidechain. Nodes run agents against each mined block of transactions. When the agents detect a specific condition or event, the network emits an alert which is stored on IPFS and linked on a public blockchain. Forta will also maintain an automated public registry of all alerts, and anyone interested in the security of a contract can consume relevant alerts via the Forta Explorer Web UI or through the Forta API. \n\nAE is seeking funding to develop a suite of Forta agents that will monitor activity on Aave protocol smart contracts. \n\nAE has already begun work on the first eight of the following proposed agents. This grant would allow AE to complete the agents already started as well as create two new agents. The list of agents and/or their behaviors can be adjusted based on input from the Aave team.  \n\nProposed Agents:\n\nAddress Watch\n       Transactions involving addresses from a watchlist.\nAdmin Events\n\tTransaction logs containing important events (e.g. OwnershipTransferred).\nHigh Transaction Amount\n        Any Borrow/Deposit/Repay/Withdraw event whose value exceeds a threshold.\nPrice Oracle Stale\n        Age of any price oracle exceeds 24 hours.\nFallback Oracle Disparity\n        Percent error between price oracle and fallback oracle exceeds a threshold.\nNew Contract Interaction\n        A new contract interacts with the Aave Lending Pool contract.\nReserve Watch\n        Aave reserve price changes more than a number of standard deviations.\nTotal Value and Liquidity\n        Available liquidity, total stable debt, total variable debt, total debt, or total value locked exceeds a number of standard deviations.\nLarge Flash Loan Profit\n        Flash loan profit exceeds a threshold.\nHigh Gas Price, High Gas Used\n        Gas price or amount of gas used in a transaction interacting with Aave protocol smart contracts exceeds a threshold.\n",

Due to the nascent nature of the ecosystem currently, we will actively list and aggregate all types of DAOs.  The focus is to create an easy way for people to search and interact with various communities: based on interest, specific organization, and trending communities.\n\nThe next step is user creation.\n\nThere will be users that are going to engage in a variety of different communities. We hope to create interactive user profiles highlighting communities they are part of, their contributions, and their interactions with other communities. Profiles can consist of badges indicating different statuses from each community (member, contributor, early contributor etc.). They will also have their own custom avatar as well as a gallery displaying their purchased/awarded content from various communities (work with communities to reward ecosystem participants outside of tokens). The best part, however, will be the content they post and contribute displaying their engagements with the communities they are part of. This will be how we look to create a gamified version of quality input, communication, and contributions.\n\nSimultaneously - engagement. \n\nThis will occur with  user creation. Gateway’s vision is to create a social graph between users and communities as well as communities to communities. The way we foresee this occurring is through the people within the community. Initially, there will be a feed on each search result, displaying community activities, content, and people. We plan to only limit posting to members of the DAO (linked to wallet by holding a certain amount of tokens or verifiable contributions) to ensure that there is only high-quality material being posted. Lurkers can follow certain users that are part of interesting DAOs as well as DAOs themselves to get an automatic feed when they first log in. This will create a user experience very similar in feel to that of Web2.\n\nLastly - DAO creation , we hope to make it possible for people unfamiliar with crypto to create their own DAOs through our platform. The goal is to make this a seamless and easy process. This would ideally take place for communities already in existence (for example, top athletes/personas who are creating investment groups) to garner traction quickly. We have already begun the process of reaching out and getting friendly with different communities. Likely, Gateway will incorporate outside tooling to make this possible and efficient.\n",

(e.g. Aave USDC Borrow APY).\n\nEach market consists of a synthetic token that tracks the value of the underlying interest rate it represents. For the Aave USDC market, if the current borrow APY is 3.6%, the value for each synthetic token to track is 0.036 USDC. This tracking is done via funding rates as in other perp markets (e.g. dydx). \n\nOur motivations for this project are that we believe perpetual contracts are the superior form of derivative swaps and thus products that leverage them will find the greatest product market fit in DeFi derivatives. Introducing a perpetual on top of interest rates is a novel take on the Interest Rate Swap market, which has been growing rapidly in recent months. Finally, we are excited about potential use cases beyond a new form of speculation in the form of APY volatility hedging which we detail in the \"Project Goals\" section.",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "Bribe creates DAO infrastructure tooling to incentivize voting. Bribe V1 introduces Voter Extractable Value (VEV) which coordinates and auctions powerful coalitions of DAO votes.  Depositors stake their governance tokens in the Bribe pool to earn income. Bidders borrow the staked votes to support or reject governance proposals. In the tradition of Flashbots, Bribe recognizes that governance markets exist and making them work better for DAOs starts with improving transparency and understanding. \n\nGenerally speaking, there are a few types of instances where we expect Bribe to participate in Aave governance (though usage of the protocol is not strictly limited to these instances):\n\nNew asset listing (Aave V2) – Most relevant upfront use case for VEV; the BOND v Saffron event comes to mind… why not direct the excess value from governance battles to stkAave holders rather than to OTC desks or lending AMMs (which are the only source of quick exposure to voting power today)\n\nNew asset listing (Aave V3) – As an asset listing admin, Bribe would function similarly to how it functions at MVP.  DAOs interested in having assets listed on Aave would need to pay a competitive rate (commensurate to the volume and risk parameters associated with the proposal) to be considered for inclusion (similar to MEV)\n\nContracts/rates – Picking a fair rate to compensate Aave DAO participants can be a tricky process. As we saw with Gauntlet late this year, we need a method for the ‘somewhat-liquid’ adjustment process for compensating firms like this. Luckily, Bribe enables a basic form of price discovery by allowing other participants to “bid up” the price of a contract with the Aave DAO. While we at Bribe do not have an opinion as to the appropriate compensation of Gauntlet, we are quite confident that Gauntlet’s profits would have ended up larger had Gauntlet paid upfront to use Bribe to support their first proposal (AIP 46) rather than submitting the second one (AIP 50) at a much lower rate.\n\nSponsoring new ideas from the Aave Governance Forum – There are tons of cool ideas in the Aave governance forum that never really get picked up. High-conviction members of the DAO could be much more willing and able to contribute ~100K USDC for a bid than stake $20M in Aave to hit quorum. After we have deployed to mainnet we’ll begin developing an approach to pick up, interpret, and properly support ideas through each stage of governance on Aave to ensure that novel proposals can be properly considered by the DAO.\n\nThe founders and backers of Bribe are big fans and holders of Aave and are excited to collaborate with and learn from this DAO/community.  We chose Aave to feature the use case for stkAave as a pioneering staked-voting token. Our team is also particularly excited about Aave V3 and the future of governance on the protocol. We hope you’ll consider our application as we would love to work with you to start charting out the future of VEV and governance markets!",

This is all with one goal; to best integrate blockchain technology into the mind and activities of the everyday member of public. \n\nThe solution we have come up with comprises two concurrent work-streams which will culminate to form one product.  The first work-stream will produce a cross-chain DEX aggregator, which allows the user to trade any two coins regardless of chain, with a single click. The second, and more elegant aspect is the creation of a financial services platform from existing blockchain products. Here we partner with current successful DeFi projects, establishing an ecosystem where a user can seamlessly navigate between them, accessing a plethora of financial services with ease. \n\nOur real value add here is ease-of-use and accessibility. From our market research, these are some of the most prominent barriers to entry for DeFi. \nThe ways we facilitate this are three-fold; \n1)\tResearch used to continually discover and best implement the most advanced DeFi projects. This way we remain project agnostic but industry bias, growing the industry as a whole whilst functioning as the face of it. Once discovered, we offer partnerships with these projects, giving them access to our research group, a new target market, and essentially indirect free advertising. \n2)\tA re-occurring issue with finance in general, but especially DeFi, is how difficult it is to use, often becoming overwhelming for the everyday user. With this, our goal is to create an incredibly simple user-interface which can be operated by even the most technologically naive investor. Research again, will play into this, but alongside the obvious interface, we are creating a backend that allows users to integrate various products that are indirectly associated with finance such as insurance without having to manually perform these functions. For example, an insurance policy on a staking protocol to mitigate hacks and malicious code. In this we are creating a pleasant and safer user experience, reducing the responsibility currently associated with DeFi.  \n3)\tOur target market is initially going to be the current DeFi market to establish a user-base, but our primary focus moving forward will be centralised crypto and traditional finance users. By marketing to these demographics, we take nothing from the projects we partner with, but add to their volume and communities by developing an otherwise inaccessible market. The flip side of this is a parallel benefit for the end user, being able to directly access DeFi without the need for centralised on/off ramping. This means every investor has the same level of access to financial products. Equally as important, our ecosystem increases awareness and intrigue in DeFi, reducing the knowledge barrier needed to access the market. \n\nIn summary, we are creating a system in which we envision, with time and development of the industry, will become the new banking structure. Rather than trying to re-invent the wheel, we encourage technological advancement in the industry in a cooperative manner, creating, in my view, the most efficient and stable way of integrating decentralised finance into everyday life. \n",

Specifically, I would like to help the protocol team build a plan to migrate less sensitive compute workloads from centralized cloud infrastructure (e.g. AWS) to a decentralized crypto based alternative (such as Akash).\n\n\nWhy decentralize further?\n\nRegulatory risk: KYC (Know Your Customer) and de-platforming risk of cloud services (e.g. AWS) due to ever changing crypto regulatory environment.\nFinancial risk: downtime (outages) caused by cloud providers prompting a shift (or backup planning) to decentralized providers.\nReputation risk: decentralized services and organizations cannot market themselves to users as “fully decentralized” if their core services rely on centralized IT.\nSecurity: reliance on public cloud providers (AWS, Cloudflare) entail outage and hacking liability. While any system is exposed to outage and hacking risk, reliance on centralized cloud providers is a very different mode than decentralized providers in regards to transparency and censorship resistance.\n",

At the same time, Dune would hire a part-time program manager to review submissions and gather requirements from the community. This person's salary would be paid by Dune. \n\nTo make things easier and more transparent for the Aave community, we intend to use a third party service to post the bounties, review submissions and handle payouts. The platform we're proposing is called Layer 3: https://alpha.layer3.xyz/ \n\n",

Our V1 is Avalanche-native and leverages Aave as its yield-bearing protocol. Satchel began as a collaboration between Blockchain at Berkeley and UNICEF. Satchel’s core features include savings accounts and loans for underbanked school communities via key DeFi protocols, splitting yield between individuals and schools for individual and local socioeconomic mobility, community governance over Satchel-wide decisions and locally-funded school projects, and tax-deductible contributions to school communities in need around the world.\n\n$SATCH is a token allocated to stakeholders of the Satchel network. On the local level, community members can use $SATCH to vote on school projects in their community. For instance, community members can now have a say in whether school funds generated by Satchel are directed towards school textbooks or healthy lunch options. In this way, residents inch towards self-governance — carving the direction of their communities and reclaiming power from largescale institutions that have long been making these decisions for them. On the global level, all stakeholders can use $SATCH to vote on Satchel-wide decisions (such as whether Satchel should expand to schools within a new developing economy or which yield-bearing DeFi protocol to integrate) and parameters (such as the initial allocation amount of $SATCH).

OceanDAO can benefit from this tool by:\n\n1) Automating & streamlining the grants operations\n2) Decentralizing the idea generation and activating the community to contribute\n3) Efficient Community-based decision making\n4) Building on-chain Reputation score for the builders to reduce the information asymmetry while voting",

Today it is difficult to visualize the future risk, we have a health factor yes but it is only in the present, the idea is to say: ok if the price of such and such assets fall by x %, am I in danger? \n\nI'm talking about an example for Aave, but it is applicable to everything, even to NFT traders, yield farmers, long term holders, market professionals, and soon to institutional investors: A risk prediction tool, based on client or institute portfolios with a scoring, risk manager, and to create specific dashboards, in a secure and multi-account manner (share strategies, analyses in a secure manner between different members of a company) \n\nThe current business model : no governance token, a paying part, and a more complex part with more options but paying so the idea is to make a great product really useful \n",

With over 70% of the hackers beginning their blockchain journey through these hackathons, we have onboarded 10,000+ devs to Web3 in the past 4 years. ETHIndia has been the platform that has helped empower builders to launch projects like Instadapp (built at ETHIndia 2018) which have gone on to add immense value to the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nWith this grant, we want to partner with AAVE for the next 3 hackathons that will be hosted under the ETHIndia Online initiative, where AAVE will be joining the company of Ethereum Foundation, Polygon, Uniswap, Chainlink and more as our partners. For the hackathon, we've already received 4000+ applications and have a great lineup of speakers/judges, including Vitalik, who will be giving the keynote address.",

EVM.Finance Hub interfaces with the leading DeFi platforms, including Aave, running back-end functionality on AWS and providing a superior User Interface (UI). Our goal is creating a DeFi Finance Hub with complete functionality for investments. By launching a quality product with numerous innovations, we will be a DeFi market leader.   \n\nWhile many DeFi products offer a variety of functionalities, we recognize the customer UI experience is blurred and lacking features that investors and traders typically experience on a traditional market exchange.  Market participants in the stock arena do not have separate interfaces for trading NYSE and NASDAQ stocks.  Instead, they rely on a single dashboard for trading through member firms including Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Robinhood and the like.  Similarly, our EVM.Finance DeFi Hub provides a solution to aggregate the disparate segments presently obscuring the DeFi space.\n \nSpecifically, we will provide a trader with a single screen identifying user current positions, the action buttons to transact on multiple DeFi platforms and necessary the metrics like interest rates, total value locked (TVL), etc. that a future transaction will return. \n\nEVM hub users will access coin pages displaying transaction options, interest rates, and expected returns for major DEX interfaces.  For example, a Tether display page will show the multiple transaction options and action buttons for all Tether liquidity pools for both Aave and Curve.  This allows the user to easily select from the best liquidity pool. Conversely, a user can view the Aave protocol display and determine which supported cryptocurrencies on Aave are best to transact with.\n",

Aztec worked with Lasse Herskind, a longtime developer at Aave, to build this integration. \n\nAztec interacts with existing L1 smart contracts — so there is no need to redeploy any smart contracts or rebuild liquidity pools. How it works: Users deposit an ERC20 and initiate the Aave deposit or borrow request via zk.money. Aztec’s zkrollup will batch transactions across users and interact with Aave's mainnet contract via a bridge contract. Users will receive an aToken on Aztec - or whichever assets they borrowed, which can be used across other DeFi protocols on Aztec. ",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "**Overview and Problem Statement**: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain have come a long way. From being just a peer to peer payment mechanism to disrupting industries the evolution has been phenomenal. As we move towards technical advancements we envision bringing the next billion people through simplified and gamified education. These are the **problems** we have envisioned:\n\n1. Majority of the current Web3 population has just been circulating from one chain to another for better yields and there is a very slow influx of new people into the web3 population. \n2. There are many projects which are focussing on onboarding builders into the web3 economy but we need more than just builders to scale the economy of Web3. We need folks who could lead operations, do marketing, build super awesome financial structures, and enable a real and sustainable Web3 economy.\n3. At one point when the incentives to be on chain will reduce, and there would be thousands of applications doing the same thing (eg: a DEX used to Swap tokens), the only way projects will be able to sustain would be where users have got used to the platform and find it easy to get their tasks done.\n\n**Solution**: We at Battlebrains ([www.battlebrains.xyz](http://www.battlebrains.xyz)) are working to solve all the above issues. We want to educate the people and reward them (Learn to Earn) but in a manner that doesn’t depend long term on just grants but by integrating various revenue sources into the protocol and enabling them to earn. (We believe in teaching “How to Fish?” than handing over the fish once.)\n\nHow?\n\nWe want to gamify the education model in the following step wise manner:\n\na) **Level 1- Level 20**: Create an basic educational structure for the non-tech (aishwary.graphy.com/blockchainbyte.in) has been an initiative of one of our [founders](http://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwary1992) where he has taught over 20k folks in the non-tech area and enabled them to onboard web3, through various courses like Cryptocurrency, Basics of Blockchain, DeFi and DAO where he manually navigates protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, TokenSets, Pools, dYdX etc and teach them to actually use the protocols live. Each cohort has around 80-100 learners and after completing the courses more than 80% of the people actually started using web3 applications.). This education will be chain agnostic. \n\nPeople who reach level 20, would have all the basic knowledge available to them to know what excites them the most and choose a career trajectory. They will have to give an exam after reaching here and a successful qualification will give them an NFT to advance to next level.\n\nb) **Level 21-Level 50**: Our current education system doesn’t care about what someone wants to pursue in life but tries to teach them everything. We do not want to do that. We imagine blockchains as cities and when you enter a city you have various universities (A university could be of DeFi and in that university you have various classes related to various topics like Lending and Borrowing and in this class you have various protocols as subjects so people can:\n\na) Go study those protocols through simplified texts.\n\nb) Create videos to navigate through the platform.\n\nc) Create a simulator which enables learning in a simulated format.\n\nOnce we integrate the above three things, we can easily plug it into the discords/apps of the protocols for new users to learn and navigate through the space and easily onboard them to the protocols. Also at this stage at a later date, we will enable a social layer (like [Lens.dev](http://Lens.dev) or [gather.town](http://gather.town)) to the protocol so that people can learn and socialise while they do it. We will enable various functionalities to make it more and more engaging (the plans are laid down but we do not want to disclose everything on the public forum for the obvious reasons.)\n\nOnce learners complete and reach level 50, we would again enable a learner test and with this NFT we would enable learners to a host of opportunities.\n\nWe will be making a simulator of AAVE in lending and borrowing part.",

Through the podcast, we will promote the voice and vision of AAVE wide and far, especially in India as our expertise lies there. \n\nDetails of the podcast:\n\n1. The podcast will be a mix of storytelling, having snippets about the projects being built in AAVE, including audio feedback in relevant places from the AAVE team. Few episodes will be free flowing conversations with AAVE members to dive deeper into the ecosystem.\nBrand signal: collaborative, exciting\nThe Podcast will be published on all audio platforms and Youtube.\n\n2. We will be releasing an episode each week, a total of 10 episodes. Episode 1 will be launched and released along with an introduction episode of 10-15 minutes  within two weeks of grant approval. We are open to having informal discord sessions and twitter spaces with other protocols, these will be free flowing conversations with the purpose of attracting listeners to the podcast.\n\n3. Our episodes will have a theme of ‘roadmap’ to AAVE, where we explore the AAVE ecosystem and discuss projects built and the various departments in it.\nTo kick off our first episode, we will be discussing developments and integrations in the last 2 weeks and will also include audio snippets from the grant recipients of a few projects and elaborate on the importance of those grants for the AAVe ecosystem. \n\nWe shall have a voice over for the host's voice to maintain anonymity and consistency for long term brand identity.\nWe request complete creative freedom to create the podcast and promise to stick to the ethos of AAVE. We would love feedback from the grants team before publishing an episode and are willing to make edits if any of the content is not aligned with AGP’s values and vision.\n\nCurrently, none of our episodes are live but we would be delighted to create a demo episode for you. \n\nUSP: Very few protocols have their own podcasts and AAVE would have an early movers advantage in building audio distribution. Our podcast would align with Aave's goal of onboarding new users and having wider outreach. We would also contribute to increasing outreach on YouTube. ",

Lifetise can scale this trend 1000X as we expand globally, utilising Aave’s untapped liquidity to help millions of people worldwide afford the lives they want.\nLifetise is building the first Fintech Metaverse. A virtual life simulator where people can plan their lives and visualise how to afford all their goals (getting a new laptop or car, owning a home, starting a business, having children, taking a vacation, saving for retirement, etc). \nWith Lifetise you create the life you want and we show you how to achieve it in real life. We  recommend both the DeFi protocols and TradFi products to help you hit your goals: from lending pools, savings/yield farming, investments, mortgages and insurance.\nWe will promote Aave to Lifetise users as a way to fund their goals, with integration that allows users to deposit or borrow through Aave directly from the Lifetise web app. \nWant to buy an apartment? Ok, let’s play it out: here is how long it will take you, how much you would need to save, where you could afford to buy, how much it will cost, and a list of steps to make it happen (including how much you could borrow through Aave for your down payment).\nLifetise is unique because as a user you get to see how earning as a depositor, or borrowing through Aave will have a direct impact on your real life and the goals you are working towards. \nEffectively, we’re a customer acquisition channel for Aave, showing users all the benefits and use cases for Aave within their lives!",

With vast amounts of blockchain data, machine learning models can be utilized to understand if certain risk profiles exist among Aave users. Hierarchical clustering provides a solution to identify groups or cohorts based on historical borrowing activity.\n\nIn this model, 10+ attributes will be collected to describe the user’s activity. This includes: the number of liquidations, borrows, repays, etc.; Loan-to-Value utilization rate, average principal amount, and many more. This type of work is often completed in traditional financial lending / borrowing, but more specifically, it is analogous to customer segmentation in marketing, sales, etc.\n\nThe final deliverable will be a user risk monitoring and control system dashboard displaying user metrics like total collateral, total borrowed, liquidation history, risk profile classification and other historical and active borrowing activity.\n\n",

This information is mainly for power users who can understand and know what they are doing. The approach with Sentible is to bring a more \"customer-friendly\" aspect showcasing a variety of Conservative, Moderate, and Advanced investing options. The Aave option would be the Moderate selection. DeFi Users will be able to lend to Aave through Sentibles Interface and learn more about the Aave ecosystem by offering a more Advanced option through borrowing. ",

This is especially problematic for mainnet ETH & Polygon for which POKT provides dedicated RPCs.\n\nBy providing Pocket Endpoints to Aave’s user facing RPC we can improve the RPC service level and contribute to Aave’s decentralization by providing it with the most decentralized infrastructure in the market, making it more resilient and censorship resistant, while allowing Aave to own their service through its stake. These endpoints would be safeguarded by Contract-based permissions, so that only Aave usage would send relays to the endpoint.\n",

Users specify their needs, wishes, and time horizon, and Buckets uses advanced algorithmic tools to calculate the most appropriate investment plan. \n\nUsers can benefit from DeFi-powered yield opportunities with partners such as Aave. The v2 of Buckets will offer the HODL Bank, a product that combines efficient tokenomics with a Play2Earn model to reward users who progress the most towards their goals. The HODL Bank is a vault that receives a portion of the protocol’s revenues and that redistributes them to individuals proportionally to their progress in the dapp. \n\nThe revenue sources will initially be twofold: \n- a fee on transactions made to partnering protocol (Aave)\n- a fee on Buckets proprietary investment strategies offered through protocols such as Enzyme\n",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "JustCause allows users to leverage the power of defi to fund causes that are important to them. We use an innovative funding mechanism to allow users to contribute to public goods, charitable organizations, DAOs, local/global/personal injustice, and much more.\n\nUsers are able to participate as either Contributors or Pool Creators. Pool Creators generate JustCause Pools for causes in need of funding. To create a pool, users provide a name for the pool, receiving address, description, uploaded image (optional), and select which tokens the pool will accept as deposits. Contributors deposit tokens into JustCause Pools which in turn deposit them into Aave’s lending protocol. The interest earned is donated to the cause associated with the Pool. When Contributors need access to their funds, they simply withdraw their original deposit and the interest accrued is left behind for the cause.\n\nJustCause will have two types of pools: Verified Pools and Unverified pools. Verified pools are created by the team, and the recipient of the funds will be verified before pool creation. An example of such a pool would be a Coin Center Pool, where the recipient is a well known charity or organization. Unverified pools are created by users of the protocol. The recipient of the funds will not be verified by the team before creation. We want to make it so ANYONE can create and fund a pool on JustCause. In our opinion, being permissionless is fundamental to the protocol sustaining in the long term. We appreciate that allowing anyone to create a pool raises an issue regarding the pseudonymous nature of blockchains. However, through integration with social media such as Aave’s new Lens protocol, we believe JustCause has the potential to be the crowdfunding platform of the future.\n\nAnother unique feature of JustCause is that the deposit information for the users and pool creators is stored on-chain in the form of an ERC721 token (NFT). A Pool Creator has the option of uploading an image at the time of pool creation. This image is stored on IPFS and an NFT is generated for the Pool Creator/Owner. Contributors to the pool also receive an NFT with the IPFS image. The Contributor’s token stores information regarding the funds deposited in the Pool. Both the Owner and Contributor NFTs act as an on-chain receipt for the pools. This allows Pool Creators to potentially reward Contributors to their JustCause pools. \n\nOur team is also exploring the concept of JustCause Pools functioning as a new type of subscription service. A future version will add features to the smart contracts to give creators the option of having a minimum deposit and locking period (where Contributors cannot withdraw their funds). Using these features with the ERC721 token acting as a digital receipt, we are able to implement a subscription service, where the subscriber can receive exclusive content/rewards from a pool creator and recoup all of their initial deposit (minus network transaction fees).\n\nJustCause is an open source, permissionless, and non-custodial protocol. This means that anyone has the freedom to create or contribute to pools or interact directly with the smart contracts on the blockchain. This freedom lies at the heart of the difference between permissioned (closed), and permissionless (open) systems.\n\nWe currently have an early proof of concept dapp running on Polygon Mumbai testnet.

This has been achieved with a lot of dedication and effort, both in the creation of adapters for the website and in the maintenance of the content. Some stats for defillama:\n- We currently track a total of 1458 protocols on a total of 104 chains\n- In the last month we have:\n    - Reviewed and merged 286 PRs\n    - Updated a total of >500 unique protocols\n    - Listed 112 new protocols\n\nWe also develop and maintain multiple public goods, such as:\n- https://chainlist.org/\n- https://token-faucet.defillama.com/\n- Our NFT dashboard\n- DefiLlama roundup\n\nWe are committed to providing data that is transparent, open and neutral, which is the reason why we have a completely open API and multiple exports for all of our data, on top of having all of our code open source (and I mean absolutely everything, from adapters to frontend and backend) since we believe that it’s important so everyone can replicate our data and audit how we calculate everything.\n\nOn top of that, we are constantly developing new things for the defi community and improving our current infrastructure and website.\n\nTo do all of this we currently employ 8 full time employees (mostly devs) and 2 interns, for who we need to pay salaries. On top of that we also need to cover the costs of our servers, which runs up to 5 figures monthly and mostly originates from paying for bandwidth to support all the users on our page and running 1.4k adapters every hour to keep our data up to date.\n\nWe don’t have any investors and we have no revenue at all, so the money needed to keep defillama running has come from only two sources: donations and self-funding.\n\nI also want to emphasize that we are one of the only source of information on Aave V3, having integrated on launch day across the 6 chains. We were also the first to provide data on Aave V2 Polygon and Avalanche.To do this we have worked closely with the Aave core team, which provides the contracts to integrate, feedback and validates the data while we support them with specific data needs.",

So far, 2 platforms have been launched, protecting investors against:\n- impermanent loss (iGain IG)\n- interest rate volatility (iGain IRS)\n- and more coming this year\n\niGain IRS is the project relevant to Aave ecosystem since the protocol is built on top of it. It allows Aave depositors and borrowers to hedge against the risk of future changing interest rates:\n- Aave depositors can buy Short tokens to secure their income if rates decrease\n- Aave borrowers can buy Long tokens to limit their costs if rates increase\n- Regular DeFi speculators/arbitrageurs can earn profits by shorting or longing Aave interest rates based on their own predictions, without any deposit or borrowing position\n- Liquidity Providers can invest in LP tokens to earn transaction fees paid by the users above\n\nIn the two first use cases, investors can either:\n- Lend/borrow stablecoins from Aave and buy the corresponding Short/Long tokens in one click on iGain IRS, via a proxy contract\n- Buy Long/Short tokens separately if they have an existing position on Aave and want to hedge\nRelevant Links \n\niGain IRS works in terms limited in time (as opposed to perpetual contracts).

Additionally, web3 lacks containers to intentionally develop and test these methods. \n\nWe’re not alone in recognizing this need: We conducted a survey of the most active contributors in web3, including operators, core team members, and founders at ENS, Friends With Benefits, Seed Club, Index Coop, Bankless DAO, Gitcoin, Llama, Aragon, and more. Among the 109 survey respondents, 40% identified **governance processes** as an aspect of community coordination that required immediate support. ****\n\n**Solution**\n\nGovernance Learning Forum 2022 (GLF22) creates a container for web3 governance practitioners to cross-pollinate with the deepest governance thinkers beyond the crypto ecosystem. GLF22 will assemble 90 of the top DAO operators experimenting at the edge of digital community governance, 15 of the deepest governance thinkers from beyond web3, and 15 facilitators recruited from within the DAO ecosystem.\n\nGLF22 is not just another series of panels, but instead is an exchange of knowledge capital and the production of governance artifacts (public goods) to inspire integration of decentralized governance practices within the DAO ecosystem at large. GLF22 will feature unique participation formats, emergent coordination methods, and co-created event modules designed to support the meaningful integration of learnings. We don’t want to recreate the inherent barriers within a typical speaker-attendee relationship. Instead, individuals who might otherwise be considered speakers will be embedded within the event. There are no attendees at GLF22, only participants.",

It is a platform where creators, public goods, and general projects can easily earn yield from their supporters - think of it as the Patreon or Buy Me A Coffee of crypto/web3. On Yieldgate, supporters can stake assets and have the generated yield be claimable by their dedicated beneficiary. This allows for a multitude of applications ranging from yield-gated content to no-loss payments, donations, investments (NFT minting), bug bounty pools (e.g. for security researchers), subscriptions, and DAOs. Our long-term vision is to become the go-to platform for programmable yield and offer an SDK after integrating with a range of DeFi protocols and selected dapps (e.g. Radicle, Gitcoin, etc.). Currently, Yieldgate is deployed on the Polygon Mumbai testnet using Aave as the yield-generating protocol. Yieldgate was created at ETHGlobal’s ETHAmsterdam 2022 Hackathon, becoming a finalist, winning 1st prize from Aave, and receiving four more prizes from Coinbase, WalletConnect, Polygon, and ETHGlobal.",

The project started in late 2021, and we've been developing our flagship 3x leverage token on Polygon with Aave V2. The lever-token uses multiple borrowing on Aave to create leverage exposures, and enable easy access to leverage by simply buying/minting the issued erc-20 token, without worrying about liquidation and etc. This is a highly scalable approach that will work on any blockchain that Aave is deployed on. Currently we are about to beta-launch the products. The code is already pushed to our Github, links below. \n\nHaving just learned about the Grant program in Permissionless Palm Beach last week, we decided to apply asap. I've met with Bill and Keeks at Aave's Booth. We also met EVM.Finance who's a grant receiver, and have heard great things about working with the DAO team!",

This series of dialogues is called Crypto Convos. \nAs most of our audience will be new to crypto, we believe it’s important to introduce them to platforms that can empower them to control their financial future. Aave is a powerful financial tool that allows users to borrow digital assets and earn interest on deposits/loans. The decentralized and open-source nature of Aave ensures there are no gatekeepers and major hurdles to prevent my target audience from financially benefiting from the perks of using Aave. We believe borrowing and lending is essential to building a strong financial backbone.\n\nEach of our conversations will be professionally recorded and offered to viewers as an educational tool to increase participation in Web3. These crucial conversations will take place inside barbershops and beauty salons in July in Philadelphia, Orlando, Miami, and Atlanta. \n\nGiven we are starting a new relationship with Aave grants, we are requesting 18K for the first two events which take place on July 7 and July 15 in Philadelphia and Orlando.\n\nAfter the Summer tour is complete, we would love to discuss the possibility of expanding to more cities over a longer period of time in the Fall.\n\nPlease see videos from two of our recent events in Miami and Atlanta:\nM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEI3772DIRg&t=19s\nA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI5waNTG4Lk\n\nThe \n\nWith an Aave sponsorship, here are the immediate benefits Aave will receive:\nAave logo on banners at the physical event\nAave mentioned and explained at each event\nAave logo included in the recap emails to attendees\nAave logo on the recap video\nAave logo on the website\nAave exclusively mentioned and highlighted in “Thank You for Coming” emails to attendees\nAave logo displayed on testimonial videos \n2 sponsored post on Blockchain Blogs (remain on the website for 6 months)\nAave logo displayed on the general flyers for the tour\nThe Tour will have 4 Conversations:\nWTF is an NFT?\nBYOB (Build Your Own Bank)  (DEFI)\nMake Cash with your Stash (Yield Farming & Staking)\nVirtual Is the New Reality (Metaverse)",

At the same time, a big chunk of crypto wealth it's in volatile crypto assets like BTC, ETH or MATIC. The holders of those volatile crypto assets want to stay in those assets expecting future appreciation (hodler strategy). The yields staying in the volatile crypto assets are low. It's possible to deposit the crypto assets in lending platforms like AAVE or Maker, and borrow stable coins, but this strategy requires continuous administration and it's exposed to liquidation risk.\n\n\nSolution\nThe Hodler vault is an ERC-4626 compatible vault that manages this process of depositing crypto into AAVE, borrowing stable coins, and investing those stables into an underlying protocol that gives a yield bigger than AAVE's borrow rate. At the same time, it keeps the funds protected from liquidation risk.\n\n\nHow it works\nThe vault has two parameters: invest health factor and de-invest health factor, for example, 1.4 and 1.3. Every crypto that is deposited into the vault, it's immediately deposited into AAVE.\n\nIf the health factor is greater than invest health factor, it borrows more stable up to leave the account in invest health factor and invests those assets into the underlying protocol.\n\nIf the health factor is lower than de-invest health factor, it de-invests from the underlying protocol and repays the loan, leaving the account again in invest health factor.\n\nAt the same time, given the price fluctuations might be fast and given in some cases the underlying protocol might now allow withdraws, there is a liquidation protection mechanism in place.\n\nThere are other two parameters: trigger health factor and safe health factor, for example, 1.02 and 1.1. On the insure endpoint the vault acquires a policy from Ensuro's Price Risk Module, that's triggered if the price of the crypto assets is below the price that corresponds to trigger health factor. The payout received from this policy will be in stable coins, this amount will be used to acquire the crypto assets (buy the dip) and deposit them into AAVE to increase the health factor (should be enough to take it to safe health factor).",

We’ve built an MVP of a fully operational web3-native governance platform that flips the way governance has been done: now it’s the community itself that can respond to prompts by submitting ideas and voting on them. For the first time, the community is incentivized to raise their voice, and governance becomes truly decentralized.\n\nDecentralized governance is particularly useful use cases that incentivize communities to become actively involved in the projects of builders and creators, including:\n\nGrants\nEndorsements\nBounties\nCompetitions\nGiveaways\nUser-generated roadmaps\nUser surveys\nText-image-and-video based contests and games\nFilm festivals and curation\nReaders choosing a writer’s next piece\nFractionalized NFTs developing fan fiction around their art\n\nThe implications change what’s possible in DAOs. Because we’re entirely on-chain (currently available across 8 major chains, including Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.), we could build out “extensible governance” for transactions to automatically execute on-chain depending on the results of a vote. We could also build “composable governance” for multiple options to execute (ie different qualities of an NFT combined to mint an NFT). And perhaps most importantly, data wizards can create retroactive algorithms to judge the results of a contest according to different metrics and standards in order to create alternate frameworks for decision-making—even long after a contest has ended.",

Initially, we will be covering defi insurance products, extending to traditional insurance services in the coming years.\n\nAbstract: SafeZen is a revolutionary decentralized insurance product with two major peer-to-peer insurance models- a zero-premium insurance model backed by community participants, and a pay-as-you-go insurance model backed by underwriters and governed by the SafeZen community members. \n\nIn the zero-premium insurance model, each individual’s assets will simultaneously be covered and will underwrite the assets of other peers in the coverage pools within the SafeZen ecosystem against any future event. Whereas, in the pay-as-you-go insurance model, the underwriters will underwrite and provide the liquidity in the coverage pools to insure users against any future unfortunate event. \n\nUnder both models, coverage pools will either be community-driven or non-community-driven. There will be risk-based sub-pools, i.e., low risk, medium risk, and high-risk pools, within the community-driven coverage pools. \n\nSafeZen initially plans to offer the following insurances: stablecoin de-peg, smart contract vulnerability, custodian risk vaults, collateral protection for crypto-backed loans, and NFT insurance. Later on, we do have plans to incorporate insurances that exist in the traditional world, such as vehicles, gadgets, crops, and travel insurances, to offer more transparency and benefits.",

We already have a (Spanish) Youtube channel focused on becoming the best audiovisual resource for learning and understanding the crypto world, where we take complex topics and turn them into interesting and easy to understand explanations that everyone can watch; 15 videos are already uploaded and we upload more every week. Our content is designed in a way that a complete beginner can watch but also an experienced crypto investor or a crypto degen will learn from it and enjoy it. Our course starts with the fundamental topics and as the viewer progresses, it will be able to understand more complex things such as the mechanics of consensus, automated market makers, the importance of decentralization and much more. We provide high quality and valuable resources to guide people on their crypto journey. \n\nAave grant project. \nOur goal is to create a full audiovisual library of resources that explain the Aave protocol in its totality; from its mechanisms, tokenomics, governance, riks, FAQs, versions and in-depth step by step tutorials that smoothly guide users in their experience with Aave. \nWe will create 4 animated videos that are based on the information provided on the official Aave docs and 6 tutorials that will fully teach the functionalities and uses of the Aave protocol. We propose that these videos are posted on the Aave document page, (and/ or in Cryptoversidad’s educational channels)  in each correspondent section and on Aave’s media, also, to create a new section on Aave’s documents tittled “Complete guide to Aave course/visual” would be an option if the team wanted. \nFurther on (on another grant), we have the intention to translate the Aave documentation AND video resources to various languages; including Spanish, French, German (subject to review by the Aave team)\n",

This allows lending protocols to function in their traditional manner with one significant addition; Our solution accesses an individual’s credit score through a zero knowledge proof and stores KYC information in a fully encrypted vault. The credit score range can be used to determine the LTV of a loan. The KYC information, on the other hand, will ONLY be made accessible should a borrower default on their loan. This induces security for lenders and accountability for borrowers, without compromising the traditional DeFi experience. An additional advantage is that it grants people access to their pre-web3 credibility derived from the traditional financial system. In short, borrowers could be granted undercollateralized loans anonymously given they fulfil their obligations correctly, but will face real life implications should they not. \n\nThis mechanism could be leveraged by lending protocols such as AAVE, in order to broaden their offering and be the first to provide undercollateralized loans to retail borrowers without undermining the essential pillars of decentralized finance. Furthermore, AAVE’s existing infrastructure for credit delegation could significantly facilitate the integration with SoLo.\n\nUnlocking the potential of UC loans is a crucial next step for fully establishing DeFi and will drive a massive wave of new applications and opportunities to the underlying ecosystem.",

We're disrupting the narrative that participating in interest-bearing instruments means leaving your money idle, doing nothing. Fluidity Money tokens (Fluid Assets) are a 1-to-1 wrapped asset that exposes holders to randomly paid rewards when they use their cryptocurrencies. With Fluidity, you can actively transfer your assets to generate yield, leading to not only increased liquidity and transaction volume, but incentives for user interactions and flow into different spaces of DeFi, while capital is participating in yield bearing protocols. To accomplish this we've had to rethink transaction classification modelling by breaking ground on reward distribution algorithms as well as innovating and creating rewards for the utility of assets in different platforms and use cases.\n\nCurrently collateral faces a dilemma of participating in functional utility or being locked up earning yield, Fluidity allows for both while gamifying the usage of assets.\n\nThrough wrapping a variety of assets with Fluid functionalities, we effectively grant utility to what would otherwise be stagnant tokens. This has the added benefit of composability and a change in how we interact with blockchain payments as a whole.\n\nThese rewards are generated by the cumulative yield generated by the underlying asset, which is deposited and lent on money markets. Fluidity earns yield on the deposited base token and distributes it to the reward pool, which is only accessible to those  who utilise the respective Fluid asset.",

Other teams can also use it, and already existing high TVL protocols can use our decentralized credit scores to balance their interest rates and collateral amounts individually for different wallets (users).\n\nTo predict of crypto borrower’s reliabilityon the basis of wallet’s data and transactions history, it is proposed to use model of trained artificial intelligence, built on the hierarchy analysis and pairwise comparisons methods. The choice of these methods is justified by insufficiency of data on defaults of crypto loans for construction of mathematical models of forecasting based on statistical approaches. \n\nThe hierarchy analysis method seems to be more reasonable by solving multi-criteria problems in complex environments with hierarchical structures involving both tangible and intangible factors than the linear logic approach. Also, the method of hierarchy analysis is a closed logical construction, providing, with the help of simple rules, the analysis of complex problems in all their diversity and leading to the best answer. \n\nMoreover, the application of this method will make it possible to include all the knowledge we have on the problem in question into the hierarchy. This approach, from our point of view, is a balanced way of solving a quite difficult problem: forecasting when making credit decisions under conditions of insufficient statistical data.",

I plan to investigate the successes and downfall of each business structure to suggest where potential adaptations may occur (member size, member say, etc.). Such comparisons include how each organization's structure provides members with a personal stake, thereby creating personal and financial incentives to realize the organization's success, and contrasts such as how the weight of each stock or token provides say in organization decisions.",

GH has spent significant time and resources to build knowledge and context about  the Aave community and technicalities of the governance process.\nToday, GH is eager to strengthen its involvement in the DAO with the support of Aave Grants. The services which GH will provide as a member of the Aave community as summarised below:\n\n> Provide Risk Assessment Analysis or support for assets to be listed on any and all Aave Markets\n\n> Improve the Risk Methodology to include liquidity on DEXs and CEXs and token schedule and reassess threshold\n\n> Write and/or publish the Aave Request for Comment for the forum\n\n> GH will be active on the governance forum providing insights, feedback, and offering support where appropriate\n\n> GH will have a close working relationship with  Bored Ghost Labs on the technical side\n\n> Support community members who wish to become more active in the DAO through building context and helping them progress ideas/proposals\n\n> GH is a governance delegate, using this power both to put forward proposals and vote to increase participation\n\nIn addition to the above work scope, GH intends to help write the payload for listing assets. However the associated funding request for this falls outside of this grant submission and will be managed within the AIP submission.",

To explain both of them, we need to explain what Mean Finance does: Our flagship product is a tool for enabling DCA from any ERC20 token to any ERC20 token in a decentralized, and open fashion through a smart user order aggregation.\n\nHere is where the first project comes into play, internally called yield-while-dca: \nRight now, the current funnel is: Alice wants to create a position to buy 100 DAI of ETH every 24 hours for 10 days, so it will need to deposit 1000 DAI and those DAIs will be idle until the moment of execution.\nWe want to enable our users to have the possibility of choosing a yield-bearing protocol in which their idle funds (until swapped) will be deposited. This could also be applied to the tokens they are buying. This would make the final funnel look like:\n- Alice creates the previously described position\n- Her 1000 DAI are deposited into aave.\n- We swap her 100 DAI + Yield generated (through aDAIs) to ETH\n- Deposit her bought ETH to aETH\n\nSecond project: This one will be a new product that will leverage the previous one, we call it Invest.\nThis product will help you DCA into a selected asset only with the yield generated by a deposit, keeping the nominal value of your principal token. An example of this would be:\n- Alice deposits 100k DAI and selects a yield earning platform (let's say a really safe one, or the best, like Aave)\n- Alice selects which token to buy with the generated yield.\n- After a week the platform will withdraw only the generated yield keeping the value of the aDAI to Alice's first deposit: 100k, while DCA-ing into her selected asset with the generated yield.\n\nBoth of these projects are EIP-4626 based, so in case a factory / adapter has not yet been designed and or implemented, that would fall into the scope of this grant.",

Airstack brings those transactions together in virtual stacks of data. For example, with Airstack you can easily pinpoint that 5040 people all used a specific dapp today, that 807 of them used that dapp plus a specific DeFi protocol, 257 of them are members of investment DAOs, and that 53 of them are also attending the upcoming ETH.cc conference. \n\nThis data is incredibly valuable to developers, traders, investors, marketers, and for various types of business development. The Airstack Data Privacy Protocol (ADPP) provides for access to this data while empowering consumers to securely lock, control and monetize it. ADPP also provides a method for ensuring that no 3rd party, including Airstack, can de-anonymize user data without their permission.",

Most places in DeFi – like AAVE itself – only allow users to earn variable interest on their deposits over time. Flashstake strategies transform this variable yield into fixed yield and pay the yield upfront to the user. This is achieved through a combination of interest rate swaps and a marketplace for the time value of money.\n\nExample of a user story:\nStani lives in 2021 and has 100,000 USDC in AAVE earning 10% or 10,000 USDC per year. Because he suspects that the bull market will not last forever and hence interest rates might drop, he looks for opportunities of fixed yield. However, he also wants to buy a new Laptop tomorrow for 2,000 USD but doesn't want to sell his crypto. He learns about Flashstake and uses our AAVE USDC strategy to lock his funds for 2 years and receives 18,000 USDC upfront. His yield equals 9% APR which is lower than the current 10% variable market rate but still a good deal considering it is fixed and upfront. Upfront yield is usually expected to be lower than current rates because in efficient markets money today is worth more than money later. Now, Stani can buy the laptop and even go on vacation without selling crypto but with the knowledge that he has actually earned this yield and that his capital will unlock in exactly two years - just in time to buy the bottom of the bear market.\nThe marketplace character is a defining feature of Flashstake. While we build some initial strategies, our protocol is 100% permissionless and cannot be interrupted or altered by us or anyone else. Anyone can develop strategies and plug them into our marketplace of time if adherent to the minimum requirements. Flashstake simply offers the truly neutral infrastructure for a whole new DeFi ecosystem to unfold – and we host the first frontend.\n\nExamples for strategies that can be created on our protocol:\n- Simple strategies that use a single AAVE vault\n- Strategies that build on top of the AAVE security module for upfront yield in AAVE token\n- Strategies that split the principal into a combination of protocols like AAVE, Compound, Yearn and others for a single common base token like DAI\n- Strategies that transform existing yield farming opportunities for a specific LP token into upfront yield\n- Strategies that provide upfront yield on LP fees as long as the LP token is an ERC20. (UniV2, Sushi, Balancer etc.)\n- Strategies that allow minting of NFTs in exchange for “waiting” (time staked of ERC20 Asset XYZ)\n- “Upfront liquidity mining” strategies where LP tokens are locked for extended durations in exchange for another token which is paid upfront\n- “Charity” strategies where the yield is redirected to a certain cause while the principal is kept in safe yield protocols such as AAVE\n- Strategies that build on top of other Flashstake strategies\n- and more…\n",

In this regard, we intend to introduce a quarterly program dubbed, opportunity summit, a program that will fall under the auspices of the young Africa for opportunities, a nonprofit organization with the aim of enabling young Africans, especially students and entrepreneurs to identify and explore the opportunities that are available to them in the advent of the adoption of blockchain, in various industries. The blockchain industry, though an emerging technology, has a lot of potential and opportunities for students, entrepreneurs and more especially the African community in helping curb unemployment deficits. Africa has a large population with myriad of challenges that could be addressed by blockchain technology, therefore, it’s our conviction that, awareness creation and the on-boarding of students at the grass root level through education would be a significant starting point for the early adoption of the Aave  protocol by individuals and businesses, with the aim helping them provide solutions that meets local expectations. In Africa, the Aave protocol hasn’t gain much attention in spite of its huge potential and the significant impact it could make in the life of many startups, developers and the continent at large, in terms of providing real time solutions that addresses the challenges that confront the continent. \n\n\nSTRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\nThe plan is to organise two set of events, an in person event and an online event, starting with the University of Professional Studies Accra. The first part of the initiative will be the in person event. However, in the case of the in person event, there will be an online access to the program. The expectation is that, by the in person event, we’ll establish campus Aave representatives. With this initiative, we are focused on educating students on the following topics for the next 3 month in two separate events after funding has been approved:\n•\tIntroduction to History of money and bitcoin \n•\tWhat is blockchain?\n•\tCreation of Aave wallet\n•\tHow to stake Aave coin\n\nThe key to the success of this project is to partner with existing student communities and associations in UPSA that will help us get a foot in the door. We then hope that the value proposition of the Aave protocol will be enough to make them want to learn more. We have already established relationships with a few associations in the university and are discussing details for the events. Taking into account the audience for our program, we will have to create interesting and insightful content with this specific targets in mind. After catching their initial interests at our events, we need to continue to provide opportunities to keep them actively engaged in the Aave community and learn more about the community. Allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, at whatever level they are starting from. \n\nPOSSIBLE CHALLENGES \nAttendance\nOne of the main challenge is the difficulty in marketing the program to our target audiences that would allow more people to learn about the Aave project. To address this challenge, we’ll collaborate with departments, clubs and associations in the University of Professional studies to promote event through their social media channels.\n\nIncentive\nthe general lack of incentive for students to participate in events could be another challenge. We have decided to provide snacks and small amount of Aave coin at our in person event, as an incentive to attract more audience. This would be a key marketing strategy to incite the interest of the students for our event.",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "The ‘Proposal Inverter’ (PI) is a protocol that allows multiple funders and contributors to collaborate on funding common proposals. It is meant to tackle the issue of inconvenient and unnecessarily lengthy communications experienced between contributors and funders by inverting the DAO-proposal relationship. Such that, instead of having many proposals for a single organization, we will have many organizations for a single proposal. This enables the collaborative funding of proposals that benefit multiple organizations, DAOs, Grant Programs, Accelerator & Incubator programs throughout the ecosystem.\n\nDAO proposal processes today can require multiple networks, tokens, protocols, and schedule timelines, which can compound in difficulty when collaborating with multiple DAOs at once. Current DAO tools incur heavy administrative costs, with tasks like KPI setting, proposal writing, payroll & funds management, communications, and community interfacing chipping away at the time available for productive deep work. Contractor teams have to develop their own HR & administrative processes just to manage the overhead of a handful of DAO collaborations.\n\nWith the Proposal Inverter, instead of navigating multiple proposal processes for each DAO that a team is seeking funding from, teams can create one common proposal that aggregates funding from multiple DAOs, creating one common platform for accountability and fund streaming among the team members.\n\nThe Proposal inverter lessens administrative burden by setting up a contract between trusted contractors and the DAO(s). This contract can persist as long as it is being funded by the DAO, or canceled. This means the responsibility to end the agreement lies with the DAO in choosing whether to opt to stop funding the proposal when it is no longer delivering value for the community. This prevents the contractors from repeatedly filing a proposal.\n\nWith the Proposal Inverter, contributors don’t have to track payment schemes from different entities because the Proposal Inverter automates the funding streaming process based on the unique parameters decided for each proposal, such as payment period, payment length, etc. Moreover, the funders can manage their budget allocation for supporting long-term projects by reserving the full amount of the required funds for the project teams while still retaining the ability to withdraw the funds from the sitting funnel if they are unsatisfied with the work delivered. As a result, a continuous flow of funds is ensured with proper accountability mechanisms in place.\n\nUltimately, the Proposal Inverter is proposed as a lower overhead funding mechanism for continuous work that delivers shared benefits to multiple groups. \n\n\n",

Unfortunately, so many of the top Defi protocols in the space have been lacking in this area in terms of participation. This logically makes sense to me as there’s no real reason for non-incentivized people to come in and provide vast amounts of time to help govern for a protocol that they have no financial stake in. \n\nUnfortunately, this lack of governance participation has also semi-plagued Aave. Barely any votes, if any at all, have reached 10% voter participation. Most fail to garner even a 5% voter turnout. When looking at the snapshot, it’s even worse, with votes often failing to get even 1% voter turnout (even .25% at times). A recognized delegate framework would in short, financially incentive those who go through the formal process and have great participation based on certain tracked metrics. One of the requirements for the “job” would be for delegates to have a platform upon which they explain their visions for the protocol and establish a quick and easy way for Aave holders to see which delegates they side with and subsequently delegate voting power for. \n\nFurther, a second arm of this framework would include incentives for Aave holders to delegate to delegates. This could include something in the form of using the receipt delegate token and staking it into a delegate pool in order to earn some extra yields and rewards for delegating! Other ideas include a Poap for parking Aave into the governance contracts and receiving yields/rewards based off of that! The reasoning for this is that I’m a core believer that governance is one of the most important parts of any DAO and protocol. Unfortunately, many people don’t participate, especially small holders. A solution to this would be unique in the space and help Aave lead in governance the same way it’s done in many other areas. The options are pretty endless, but the ultimate goal is the same: Increasing delegate participation; increasing Aave holders participation in governance; all towards the goal of a more active and efficient governance process.\n",

Our core focus is on the UX and creating the best user experience in DeFi. On the back-end, the strategy router routes user funds to multiple audited yield farming strategies. We also monitor, reallocate, rebalance and auto compound the rewards. At first we'll be multichain, but we're building cross-chain functionality. Aave will be part of our yield farming strategies.",

We would like to extend the project, index Aave V3 data, and implement the dashboard for Aave v3. The tool will help track the below metrics:\nCohort analysis of user transactions on a month by monthly basis \nCohort analysis of Deposit amount on a month by monthly basis \nAggregated metrics like the total no of repeat users\nFunnel analysis helps track user retention activity based on the number of transactions they have done.\nThe dashboard will be hosted on: https://dapplooker.com/category/defi?type=dashboard.\n\nCombined Defi Analytics Dashboards would help track the following metrics across the mentioned networks : \nWeekly total tokens borrowed/deposited \nDaily/Weekly borrow/deposit amount by the pool \nUnique borrowers/depositors \nAverage borrow rate past 30 days\nTypes and count of swaps\n\nImplement Defi Analytics Comparison Dashboard for Polygon and Avalanche on Aave v2 and Aave v3 will help users understand usage of both protocols and understand the adaptability of Aave across both overlapping networks (Polygon and Avalanche)",

Its development was funded with a grant from the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP). It enables arbitrary contract logic to roll up the voting weights of disparate parties into a single delegated vote. This enables all kind of new use cases. The one that's relevant for AAVE is the ability to vote with Governance tokens while they're active in DeFi. One could, for example, deposit your UNI in AAVE then vote proportionally on proposals with your aUNI. We're hoping to get a grant to build exactly that. We'd extend the AToken contract to enable checkpointed proposal voting for holders of Governance Tokens, while maintaining all the existing AToken functionality.",

These solutions are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\n\nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves community leaders without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes.\n\nTo address these limitations, RnDAO is launching a research project to explore techniques employed both inside and outside the DAO ecosystem to surface those requiring minimal administrative effort from DAO community managers and minimal disruption to DAO members. We believe this approach ensures more representative insights and paves the way for broad adoption of real-time analytics and benchmarking across DAOs.",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "Overview: The TuffDAO protocol has created a platform through which members can earn more investing in tokens they believe in without introducing any additional risk. \n\nWe've accomplished this task by creating a factory framework for the generation and monitoring of a new group of assets we call Volatility Bond Tokens. Utilizing this framework, DAO members can vote and create VBT instances pegged to any token(s) of their choice, observe VBT contract growth and enter/exit their positions through the VBT marketplace.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVBT Contracts:\n\nA VBT contract is essentially a bundle of assets which grows in value over a set period of time. After this period of growth, the VBT contract reaches maturity, converting all assets it holds into Ethereum. VBT holders may then exchange their tokens with the VBT contract for an equivalent amount of Ethereum. For example, if an individual held 1% of the total supply of a VBT token, they could redeem 1% of the total Ethereum held by the Treasury on the contract maturity date.\n\nThere are four aspects which make up a VBT: The VBT Treasury, Transaction Fees, Yield Farming, and Contract Maturity. \n\n1. When creating a VBT contract, the DAO first determines which token(s) they'd like that contract to be pegged to. VBT tokens are then sold to the market in exchange for the token(s) the DAO voted for. After the sale is complete 90-95% funds raised are placed in the VBT contract's \"Treasury\". The Token is now live, and the Treasury is set to grow in value until its maturity date. \n\n2. Although VBT holders can wait until the VBT's maturity date to redeem their tokens for Ethereum, they can enter or exit their position at any time by selling their token on the market. Any time a sale occurs, 1% of that transaction is taken and placed into the VBT Treasury - essentially amounting to a 1% entrance fee for the VBT contract. Over time, the money collected in this manner adds up significantly, allowing the VBT Treasury to grow well beyond what it initially held. Further, because no new VBT tokens are minted over the contract's lifestyle, VBT holders are in essence gaining that money themselves due to the redemption function baked into the maturity date of the VBT contract. \n\n3. In order to compound growth, the Treasury places the majority of funds it holds into yield farms (with a small amount being reserved for operational costs of running the contract). Of course, the growth of these funds varies depending on the yield farm used, meaning it is only a secondary growth vector for the VBT Treasury. \n\nNotably, our first VBT contract instance \"tDUU\" exclusively uses Aave yield farms for this purpose. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe DAO & VBT Ecosystem:\nWhen the DAO wants to create a TuffVBT contract they must vote to determine several key variables: \n\n1. They must decide which underlying assets the VBT is pegged to. For example, the DAO community could vote and determine they want to create a VBT which holds Wrapped-Bitcoin, Ethereum and DAI in its Treasury.\n\n2. They must determine in what ratio these tokens will be held by the Treasury. For example, they could say the Treasury will be distributed as 50% ETH, 25% WBTC & 25% DAI. *(This contract would be called tEBD.\n\n3.They then can vote for the various parameters in the contract; eg. transaction fee percentage, underlying assets and ratios for new VBTs.\n\nWhen this occurs, the DAO factory framework will generate the new contract and the DAO will execute a sale of these tokens taking payment in Ethereum. Once the sale has concluded the contract will go live and users can buy or sell their tokens. \nIn order to support our ecosystem, we are currently creating a supporting dApp for the platform. Through this dApp users will be able to buy/sell their tokens, monitor VBT/DAO token growth, as well as observe other metrics like fees collected that day or yield farm profits. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

This will encourage users to buy AAVE tokens tand stake them on Ithil to earn single-sided APY. \nIn the future, we foresee possible synergies by creating more advanced strategies on top of Aave.\n\n-- About Ithil --\nIthil empowers DeFi users to run complex strategies with a single click, using their own and/or borrowed funds, on a variety of external protocols. We are supporting interconnection among Liquidity providers, investors, and other protocols by providing a completely new spectrum of investment options via a number of techniques ranging from low to high risk.\n\nAll of our strategies can be executed and tracked from the same UI, hiding the complexity inside the smart contract and gas-optimising the execution within a single transaction.\n\nIf you haven’t heard about the project - that is normal; we’ve been building in near-complete stealth mode since November 2021. We’re currently going through our second security audit without any major issues found during the first one, and we’re running a private testnet, with a public testnet following shortly after at the end of August. The mainnet release on Ethereum is planned for late Q3 2022.",

The incredible number of Web3 enthusiasts in Turkey lack a platform where they can obtain information, as a result of which it is difficult for them to make a positive contribution to the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nWe want to change that. By creating a website where we will publish educational and informative content about the Aave platform, we want to spread the Aave brand in Turkey, encourage crypto users in Turkey, which has a large crypto space, to use the Aave platform, and increase awareness of the general crypto and Web3 ecosystem.\n\nAs stated in the study, over 79% of Turkish users rely on Twitter and Telegram as sources of information, so we aim to create an identity on such platforms as well to spread Aave's mission and encourage its use. As a result, we are going to create a website, Telegram, and Twitter channels under the 'aaveturkey' brand name. In addition, we aim to increase the number of our readers with the weekly published newsletter. \n\nIn addition to these, we will contact other web3 ecosystem partners in Turkey and organize joint events. \n\nIn summary, thanks to our experience in organizing events in the past, we want to work in many areas to promote the Aave ecosystem in Turkey and to increase the user rate.\n\nWe have specified the details in the project goals section.",

Establishing clear order of operations for communications, governance, and voting cycles\n2. Collecting and forwarding input from significant stakeholders\n3. Supporting the distribution and release of relevant information during every proposal\n4. Building relationships with key delegates to handle their inquiries and to ensure a strong feedback loop between the project and the community\n5. Soliciting feedback (both quantitative and qualitative data) from delegates—suggesting and overseeing improvements to delegate relations as necessary\n6. Generating standardized and recurring disclosures including:\n    - Proposal Summaries- A recap of the history, implications of proposed changes, discourse, and sentiment for every proposal\n    - Weekly Recaps - An outline of all votes, proposals, and changes executed in a DAO\n    - Activity Reports - Quarterly reports on governance activity, participation, and feedback\n    - Events - A catalog of all proposals, calls, and relevant events in an exportable calendar\n    - Overview - A comprehensive description of the project and its governance structure\n\nWhy use Governance Facilitators?\n1. Neutrality - Neutrality is essential to be a credible steward of governance within Aave. Ultimately Boardroom has this mandate because it is trusted by governance participants across multiple protocols to create and manage governance tooling without bias toward outcomes.\n2. Consistent Support - The governance processes of organizations like Aave struggle to operate consistently and clearly without continuous coordination. Boardroom Governance Facilitators fulfill the role of officials in traditional systems of governance, leaving those involved in governance able to spend more time on decision-making and discussion.\n3. Offload Delegate Responsibilities - informed delegates spend 20+ hours a week engaging in governance forums, lobbying activities, and extensive off-forum work discussing with proposer teams, DAO members, and other delegates.\n4. Content and Communication - Content creation and communications are key pieces of governance maintenance. It isn't easy to facilitate effective governance if high-quality communication platforms and norms do not exist. Governance Facilitators will provide consistent independent analyses and summaries of proposals, governance changes, and events tracking to ensure delegates and tokenholders are kept continually informed.",

Basically, we'd like to apply for bridge funding since our initial proposal to the DAO has been perceived as too complex (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ujrqh7JZ81L9rc4FJnYEEQ4oEsNU93TOYpzFSvlJtHg/edit#) and that it requires too much time from contributors. \n\nAs such, we'd like to spend 1 week considering how we can further refine this larger governance proposal into something that provides the maximum amount of improvement in terms of security outside of looking at the code itself (the role of auditors) for the least amount (ideally next to 0) work for the contributors who are already extremely constrained in terms of time.  \n\nWe're asking for money for this because we've spent a few days drafting these proposals so far but given the feedback we've received we're simply not ready to put it up to be voted on. More refinement is needed, and this requires time. Given that we're running low on funds we're requesting a small bridge grant so that our time isn't a complete write off in terms of hours expended. This way our larger proposal can get rejected and we can still have something to show for our work which to us is very important at this time. The small amount of money we request reflects this. ",

Moderaters can also use this information as well as data about how experienced the user is with DeFi applications in general to make support more efficient.\n\nWith our plan of a fully-fledged customer support product, we want to provide AAVE a single platform to process requests from all support channels (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, email and website). We will leverage on-chain data to provide real-time customer support based on recent user transactions and classify users according to their experience with web3 and importance for the protocol.",

It encourages users to interact with various Web3 protocols, which in turn provides positive feedback to the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nOur mission is to visualize on-chain identity and create an open and inclusive metaverse land system that is based on universal web3 building blocks, such as ENS and wallet activity.\n\nPhi has two main components: \n1) Philand — Lands generated from ENS domains. ENS can work as a Metaverse address system(e.g. vitalik.eth would be Vitalik’s Metaverse land address.)\n\n2) Phi Object —Objects(ERC1155) tied to various on-chain activities. Examples of on-chain activities to claim Phi Objects:\n・Token Holding: Holding more than 1 ETH\n・Token Swapping: Swapped 1/5/10 times on Uniswap\n・NFT Holding: Holding 1 Loot\n・Voting: Voted more than 1 time on Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, a variety of on-chain data can be tied to an individual’s identity, and by putting these various objects into their land, players can show their On-Chain Identity.\n\nWe are trying to create the most influential metaverse space, starting with a more visualized on-chain identity profile and then increasing the social and gaming aspects like habbo(https://www.habbo.com/), cyworld(https://cyworld.com/), and Animal Crossing(https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/ )\n\nMindmap\n- Music NFT integration\n- World Map (Connected multiple lands)\n- Playable Avatar\n- Text Chat\n- Protocol Auction\n- Mini game(casual game fully on-chain)\nand more...",

As protocols like Aave continue to onboard more users, it is increasingly important to equip users with necessary risk-management analytics for healthy activity. \n\nSafeguarding users against risk ensures long-term sustainability for the protocol, as well as an improved user experience, which is a competitive differentiation to other borrowing and lending protocols. Thus, we are building defishy.xyz, a suite of analytics tools with which Aave users can better gauge risk as well as opportunity. Our first project that has received great reception is a liquidation health dashboard that enables stakeholders within borrowing & lending ecosystems to manage liquidation risk. \n\nFrom this, we are planning to expand our product suite further, including the tools/metrics outlined in this proposal. Our first dashboard for the Aave community was to democratize current liquidation health scores. We built this for free, and we believe more builders supporting the ecosystem directly will be beneficial to the Aave community as a whole.",

The protocol generates yield on donor’s capital and automatically donates it to the charity of their choice. IHELP also allows donors to directly contribute principal to a charitable cause. Donors can opt to receive a tax receipt for their donations.\n\nThe protocol is currently deployed on Avalanche and we’re seeking to deploy it on Ethereum.\n\nHow does it work? \n•The protocol is set up to easily deploy charities approved by the IHELP DAO.\n•Donors can easily browse the list of charities on the protocol and  choose the causes they wish to support.\n•Donors can donate in two ways: direct donations or yield donations. \n•Yield donations work by pooling donor deposits and lending them out in protocols such as AAVE. These deposits generate yield that is then donated to the donor’s desired charitable cause.\n•Donors can withdraw or reallocate their capital at any time.\n•Donors receive HELP tokens for contributing yield to charities.\n•Donors can then stake their HELP tokens and receive staking rewards. \n\nDonation Distribution & Protocol Fees\nFor any given amount of yield generated by a donor’s  capital, the proceeds are allocated in the following manner:\n•80% to IHELP Foundation: The IHELP Foundation receives and promptly processes the donation by converting it to fiat and forwarding the donation to the charitable cause.\n•10% Staking Rewards: These rewards will be claimable by token holders that stake their HELP tokens. This is the main mechanism to incentivize use of the protocol outside of the core reward of supporting a worthwhile charitable cause.\n•10% IHELP Protocol Development: Will be distributed to the IHELP DAO treasury.\n\nWhen donors donate directly to a charity, 95% of the donation  will go towards the charity, 2.5% towards the staking pool  and 2.5% towards IHELP’s protocol development.\n \nFor detailed information, please refer to our docs: https://docs.ihelp.finance/\n",

For example, we are currently working with an up-and-coming artist who needs roughly 10,000 USD in audio and technical equipment to be able to make the next step on his journey. By partnering with us, we conduct an NFT sale where customers pay with time through our upfront yield infrastructure to donate to this artist and receive an NFT that connects them to the artists journey from the ground floor!\n\nWe connect to artists through continuous networking, we provide a time-to-mint launchpad and marketing, the artist receives instant revenue, customers receive NFTs that connect them to the artist, and then redeem 100% of their assets after a period that they define (as long as the mint price is covered). Yield will be generated primarily through the awesome Aave V2 and V3 strategies which will create customer peace of mind that their assets are secure when conducting time-mints.\n\n",

It features the insolvency level of all major lending markets, and provides transparency for users who interact with those platforms. For example, some platforms, e.g., Venus Finance or Inverse Finance, have huge bad debt, but they never display it on their website.\n\nThe bad debt dashboard already monitors Aave v2 on Ethereum, and gets community traction (https://twitter.com/Risk_DAO/status/1534558450696470530). With this grant, we will expend it to track the v3 markets. This requires both a development effort, as our current code does not support Aave v3, and also devops effort, as v3 is spreaded across multiple chains.\n\nIt should be noted that while the vast majority of the Aave market is on Ethereum, the multichain deployment comes with a potential higher risk, and thus, transparency around the bad debt it has is even more needed. Once this task is completed, Aave will be the only major lending platform who features and monitors its bad debt across all of its multichain deployments.\n",

As it stands at the moment, blockchains operate like their own isolated economies, making it difficult for everyone to move and access liquidity; protocols can struggle to attract liquidity if the chain’s TVL is low and blockchains struggle to onboard new users. \n\nThe current solutions rely on bridges that have proven themselves to be vulnerable to attack, have problems of peg-deviation of wrapped assets on non-native chains, a need to maintain liquidity pools, and incur high costs for users. Not to mention how many users are put off using a new chain due to needing gas to get started and not knowing which DEXs to use. \n\nThis contributes to protocols struggling to attract the liquidity that they need to thrive. \n\nWe are solving that problem by introducing Synthetic assets, specifically Synthetic LPs to facilitate seamless liquidity aggregation across different chains.\n\nSynthLPs are minted 1:1 to LPs which are obtained on the basis of initial liquidity providers of USDC to Entangle.\n\nUsers will be able to exchange SynthLPs on any chains representing LP positions on any other chain without ever having to leave their “home” chain through Entangle's Internal Limit Order Book DEXs located on each chain consisting of pair SynthLP/USDC. This makes it easier for users (no more bridging) and helps protocols attract liquidity as it is now significantly easier to provide liquidity cross-chain.\n\nIf, for example, a user has a USDC on Ethereum, and sees a good opportunity for yield farming on Avalanche´s TraderJoe via Entangle for the pair AVAX/USDT.\nThey will now be able to directly deposit into the Avalanche farm without having to add a new RPC Network inside their wallet, bridge, split their USDC into AVAX & USDT, and finally stake the LP and compound it. They simply buy the AVAX/USDT SynthLP on Entangle and we do the rest, auto-compounding the underlying LP and reflecting the value accrual on Entangle's Internal Limit Order Book DEX on Ethereum.\n\nBased on demand on the Internal DEXs, Entangle is able to scale the original liquidity deposited by magnitudes through its own unique Rebalancing Logic mechanism.\n\nTo facilitate this easy aggregation of liquidity we are building out our own Tendermint-based blockchain using the Cosmos SDK, where we will offer nodes run by DPoS delegating/validating mechanisms through our $ENTGL token to ensure security and decentralization. \n\nEntangle Blockchain is imbued with our own Oracle Solution, Entangled Distributed Oracle Services (EDOS), which works in tandem with Entangle Validators to facilitate transactions within all the Entangle applications including cross-chain Liquidity Provisioning & Aggregation (SynthLPs), Single Asset Liquidity Provision as well as a truly cross-chain overcollateralized stablecoin enUSD that can freely move across blockchains.\n\nOur goal is to facilitate the easy, fast, and secure aggregation of liquidity while providing protocols such as Aave with opportunities for the scaling of liquidity across all blockchains (EVM and non-EVM) to improve DeFi for everyone. We envision a truly omnichain future with stronger and more fluid connections between blockchains, and more opportunities for users, protocols, and the chains themselves. \n\nEntangle is a DAO, with holders of $ENTANGLE and $EnUSD being able to vote on the direction of the protocol. We want the project to be as decentralized as possible, with the community as active and involved as they can be, from acting as validators/delegators to voting on the proposals, Entangle aims to be a DAO and to be inclusive and empowering of the community. \n",

There are several significant disadvantages of using these tools for community knowledge sharing, particularly Q&A:\n- Questions have a short window of visibility to the community and disappear in the flow of the new messages in communication threads; \n- Existing questions are hard to find causing the same questions to be asked repeatedly;\n- Questions and answers are not indexed by search engines as Google;\n- Questions and answers are not curated;\n- Communities in different messengers and different languages exist in silos.\n\nThe diagram below shows current knowledge-sharing flows in the Aave community: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1SbciJROSuRpTT0WxyHKUs0344R1GiaoG/view?usp=sharing\n\nWe are proposing to streamline knowledge management & discovery in the Aave community.

We employed a “1 student = 1 vote” model, held various governance calls, and voted on several proposals with 70+ students participating from over 13 universities around the  world. This model enabled international students to participate in governance without the bureaucracy of having to set up a blockchain club at their school.\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQhA9u5noOk\n- https://twitter.com/BlockchainEdu/status/1397651843069747201?s=20\n\nWe also assisted several blockchain clubs, including Rutgers, Blockchain at Michigan, and Penn Blockchain, in setting up their own Aave, Uniswap, and Compound delegates through educational workshops with Harvard and Berkeley and direct connections to interested parties like a16z who wanted to delegate their voting power to more student groups.\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txBt_dMmpg8\n- https://medium.com/blockchainedu/the-ben-uniswap-meta-delegate-6f9a3a81edd7\n- https://sybil.org/#/delegates/aave/0x070341aA5Ed571f0FB2c4a5641409B1A46b4961b\n- https://www.tally.xyz/profile/0x13BDaE8c5F0fC40231F0E6A4ad70196F59138548?governanceId=eip155:1:0x408ED6354d4973f66138C91495F2f2FCbd8724C3\n- https://www.tally.xyz/profile/0x070341aA5Ed571f0FB2c4a5641409B1A46b4961b?governanceId=eip155:1:0x408ED6354d4973f66138C91495F2f2FCbd8724C3\n- https://www.tally.xyz/profile/0x13BDaE8c5F0fC40231F0E6A4ad70196F59138548?governanceId=eip155:1:0xc0Da02939E1441F497fd74F78cE7Decb17B66529\n- https://www.tally.xyz/profile/0x070341aA5Ed571f0FB2c4a5641409B1A46b4961b?governanceId=eip155:1:0xc0Da02939E1441F497fd74F78cE7Decb17B66529\n- https://www.tally.xyz/profile/0x66Aa8Bee5366b6b48811AE0Dac9Fe5e1EEfE1621?governanceId=eip155:1:0x408ED6354d4973f66138C91495F2f2FCbd8724C3\n\nOne key insight from running the Meta-Delegate was that, while some student groups were well prepared to properly and fully run a delegate, mainly the US-based clubs, most students found too much of a knowledge gap and a lack of educational resources around governance, especially those internationally. \n\nThus, our aim is to create a video course “Intro to Governance” to teach students everything from voting to setting up a delegate, evaluating proposals, acquiring voter power, and acting out as a responsible delegate.\n\nThe course will be hosted on BEN Learn, our new online educational platform and mobile app (iOS and Android) for all our courses, lessons, videos, tutorials, deep dives, and more, with over 2,000 enrolled users\n\nOur most recent course, Solidity Fundamentals, has over 35 video lessons with companion audio transcripts and multiple quizzes. It has also been fully translated into Hindi as part of our international outreach efforts. It is currently our flagship course to prepare students to network at the conferences (Messari Mainnet, Consensus) and hackathons (ETHDenver, Solana Breakpoint) that we partner with.",

The first case study will be an online document of approximately 3,000 words on Aave. Over time, I hope to expand the range of case studies until there is a comprehensive set of educational resources for the Crypto/Web3 industry going forward. Currently no such resources exist. \n\nThe original Aave Web3 case study document will include the following sections:\n\nHistory of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). \nHistory of Aave. \nWhat Aave’s product/s are. \nHow Aave is organised. \n\nThe case study starts in “DeFi Summer” 2020. Students are presented with the emergent conditions around yield farming and competitive token drops at the time. It explains how Aave successfully navigated this hyper-competitive environment, how Aave accomplished its progressive decentralisation and how Aave has expanded into areas such as decentralised social media with Lens. The case study includes a set of discussion questions toward the end that challenge them to imagine how Aave might evolve in the future, what products it might develop and what areas it might attempt to reinvent. The case will be positive in tone. It is not about problems with Aave, but uses Aave as a successful model students can emulate in order to prepare them for the Web3 industry (such as interviews, conferences, networking, etc.). The case study will be available for review by Aave before launch.\n",

Specifically we noticed the following pain-points that we would like to solve with our UhI.\n\n1. Users do not get a clear idea of what they can do after connecting their wallet, and why they would be interested in supplying and borrowing certain assets in the first place. \nWe want to solve this by having an assistive UI, that walks them through the process of borrowing and supplying dummy assets and explaining (a) what they can do with the borrowed assets and (b) how they would earn by supplying the assets already present in their wallet.\n\n2. Non DeFi-native users do not understand the jargons and the graphs presented in the details page for each asset. They are unable to decide which assets to borrow and supply, and what the terms and conditions for these transactions would be. \n\nOur UI would prominently display small bites of information in layman language, about each asset. On clicking borrow or supply, the UI would display in simple language, what that would mean, explaining terms like liquidation threshold. This helps the user makes decisions without studying a detailed dashboard of data. \nThis is of-course meant to help people just get started in DeFi with Aave. All the detailed information in the current UI (https://app.aave.com/) would also be available at a click so that as people learn about DeFi, they can make better decisions by utilising other granular details of an asset. We will also make sure to either remove the jargons or explain them wherever they are mentioned in the UI.",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "At its peak, DeFi’s TVL hit over $200bn, an impressive feat for a decentralized and distributed value-exchange system that has unlocked wealth and opportunity for millions around the world. Despite that, there are still billions of people in the world who remain unserved from traditional financial institutions, for whom DeFi has the real opportunity to drive real systemic change in their lives. For example, such use-cases could be: open fairer lines of credit for well-established and high impact businesses throughout emerging economies, who are currently offered near extortion-level lending rates from their traditional financial institutions, give powerful financial tools in rural areas on mobile-native DeFi platforms, and allow for non-crypto native collateral to be recognized as valued collateral in DeFi, among other use-cases. However, for these conditions to be true, there is still an underlying base layer of infrastructure that is missing from the crypto ecosystem. Crypto was never truly designed to serve last-mile communities in emerging economies, therefore, we have much work to be done to actually get there. \n\nAt Trust Protocol, we believe the following:\n\n1. DeFi should be accessible to whose who have most to benefit from it (e.g. SME’s in emerging economies, small farmers in rural communities, etc)\n2. There is substantial crypto-native capital sitting on the sidelines that can be deployed in order to drive real-world impact in these economies\n3. Crypto was never designed to serve these communities, and we therefore need to build better composable infrastructure to bridge the real world and the on-chain world, which ultimately provides better assurance and trust to parties across the value flows\n4. Trust is the key missing barrier when it comes to unlocking value to establish a truly global peer-to-peer value exchange platform\n\nTherefore, we are building the infrastructure to facilitate these conditions to be true. Our product consists of two main building blocks:\n\n1. the smart contract infrastructure that facilitates efficient fund flows that allows us to facilitate supporting projects that are currently operating in the real world and driving real world impact.\n2. a trust graph that connects investors and borrowers as an indication of degrees of separations, ultimately giving users across the crypto ecosystem higher degrees of trust when engaging with novel and established dApps and users\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how things operate:\n\nFor the initial version, the smart contract consists of a capital pool and a reserve pool. In the capital pool, a borrower is able to open a new credit line with a target borrow amount, subjected to thorough due diligence done beforehand. Once the credit line is opened, investors can deposit either USDC or other whitelisted ERC20 tokens (e.g. AAVE, UNI, COMP). Once the target amount is reached, the ERC20 tokens are sent to Aave to borrow USDC. The borrower is then allowed to withdraw the USDC from our platform. We utilize Aave’s aToken design mechanics to keep track of the real time debt position of the borrower. The debt position is viewable through our frontend platform. During repayment, the borrower repay USDC into the capital pool, together with the pre-agreed interests. A portion of the interests go to the reserve pool, where the proportion is determined by the reserve factor. The reserve pool acts as an insurance to cover bad debt in the event of a default. \n\nThrough our conversations with many liquidity providers, DAOs and institutions, we notice that trust is of utmost concern. Investors are more likely to lend to someone with a direct or indirect connection rather than a complete stranger. As such, we aim to leverage on the rich transactional data on the lending platform to build the foundation of a trust graph, which help unlock the trust and data visibility of the underserved businesses and communities. Users (investors and borrowers) will receive a non-transferrable NFT representing a node in the graph the first time they interacted with the platform. An edge is formed in the trust graph when there is an interaction between the users, for example when an investor lend to a borrower. Users on the platform can also invite other users through a referral link. The referral link is in the form of a signature and can only be redeemed by the corresponding address. Once redeemed, an edge is formed in the trust graph between the invitee and the referrer. We are currently still working on the incentive mechanism for users to participate in the trust graph. In the long run, the trust graph will be the foundation to unlock better-informed decision for the undercollaterized lending protocol that we are building. \n\nAs we are building, we are going to be running a pilot with a real world social enterprise in Guatemala, Albedo Solar where we are going to be running through the flow of funds utilizing our smart contract infrastructure, onboarding Albedo into DeFi and crypto, and launching the initial trust graph edges across the actors that are involved in the value exchange with Albedo. We have therefore set up our website where you can learn more about the unlock that Trust Protocol will bring: http://www.trustprotocol.xyz - as well as the pilot we are going to run: http://www.trustprotocol.xyz/albedo-solar\n\nFurther technical details are in the linked Github below.",

We do this through the creation and distribution of educational content. During this year, we have developed and launched a 36 video series on the basics of blockchain and Web3. \nIn addition we have created an animated 15 video series explaining everything about the Aave protocol and 6 step by step tutorials; with 80 minutes of amazing content, we manage to give out a full understanding of the Aave protocol as a whole. (This was as a part of the first grant we received from the AGD).\nIn short: We are a public good that provides high quality and valuable resources to guide people on their crypto journey.\n\n\nAave grant project: \nAave 's documentation Spanish translation part 1. \nWe will translate a part of Aave’s documentation websites into Spanish to make the Aave ecosystem more accessible to the Latinoamerican builders and users. \nThe reason we see value in this grant is because during the past months, the ecosystem has seen a significant rise in interest, participation and involvement from the Latin American community. From various events in Mexico City like EthMexico, Entrando al Espacio Cripto, Polkadot Decoded; in Argentina with EthLatam and LaBitConf; in Colombia with EthBogotá, EthLatam 2, Devcon VI and several other relevant events in other latam countries. We notice there is a big opportunity to foster and cultivate new projects coming from these countries which can positively impact the ecosystem. And a reality in Latin America is that most people don’t speak English. We believe that everyone should have access to Aave’s documentation, regardless of their language or background. In addition, even the people who do speak English, normally prefer to learn about these new topics in their mother language to have a more complete understanding of the information. \nThe complete idea is to translate all of Aave’s docs, but as a start to the project, and to show our great quality and commitment, for this grant we propose to translate the following pages which we consider are the fundamental and most important pages from the Aave docs: \nAave Document Hub\nIntroduction to Aave\nDepositing and earning\nBorrowing\nAave v3 features\nSwap and Repay with collatera\nTesting Aave Protocol\nLiquidations \nFlash Loans\nGovernance\nMigration and Staking\nTroubleshooting\n\nIn addition to translating these pages, we will share them with the Latam community, to encourage people to learn more about Aave and start getting involved in the ecosystem! This will be done through social media posts, twitter space, and sharing them directly in the most important telegram groups, such as EthMexico, DeFiLatam, Espacio Cripto and Ethglobal Spanish. \n",

The former gives a high-level breakdown of the types of wallets that interact with the platform, while the latter set of datum provides a nuanced picture of how the platform is being utilized (user needs and habits).It is at this point the data is transformed and fed into an unsupervised machine learning model that best groups the observations according to behavioral and descriptive similarity. These groups are then visualized and re-expressed as easy to understand personas.\n\nThe process implemented code and a slide deck of the results will form the deliverable presented to the Aave community.",

Cross-chain bridges remain a major target for hackers, with 3 bridges breached this month (October 2022) and nearly $600 million stolen. \n\nTookey identifies threats of private key compromise and fraudulent transaction pushing, letting developers to integrate and deploy distributed private key management solutions quickly.\n\nThis is now possible due to the implementation of Threshold signature schemes. TSS allows several people to sign transactions using a single public key.\n\nPluggable Tookey's core components are the TSS participation library and the Key Service API. These components enable the development of third-party applications such as DeFi protocol maintenance tools, end-user wallets, CEX depositaries, escrow services, and so on.\n\nVideo Pitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeSptdkAJZE  \nTookey showcase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6crgnJ75Po4 ",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "The scope of Invictus Labs is to construct a platform for measuring the credit risk of DeFi (lending) pools. We achieve that by modelling the relationships between entities that partake in borrowing through causal inference and machine learning techniques.\n\nThe end goal is to measure the risk of default of any borrower as a function of his interaction with all the other borrowers he may have been exposed to. This means that we not only take into account data about the borrower as a standalone entity but also the ripple effects of the actions of all the other entities from the DeFi ecosystem.\nTo achieve this, we are constructing a quantitative engine made of 2 Models (Borrower and Borrower-to-Borrower), through which we create an Overall Credit Risk. The Borrower model will output the individual's credit risk, whereas the Borrower-to-Borrower model measures the systemic risk the borrower is exposed to.\nFurthermore, the Borrower-to-Borrower is constructed via a topological network of borrowers and entities, along with measuring the relationships between them. The entities and relationships are obtained using a domain-expert mathematical model combined with a text-to-entity approach, in which key phrases and topics from the unstructured text are mapped into graph nodes and edges.\nWe use both on-chain and off-chain data from borrowers, along with a real-time alert system to update the risk indicators. Finally, our product allocates borrowers into trenched lending pools to minimize the risk of default of the lending pool as a whole, while also ensuring that liquidity is available.\n\nFor the detailed System Architecture and further steps, please refer to the GitHub link in the section below.",

It is built for both beginner and advanced DeFi users and is permissionless, trustless, and easy to develop extensions for. SlothyFi makes it simple for anyone to automate their DeFi strategies, regardless of their level of technical expertise.\n\nThe SlothyFi dapp allows users to create their own personalized workflows using a modular approach. Our user-friendly interface enables users to combine starting blocks, action blocks, repetition blocks, and split blocks to craft the perfect automation. No coding skills are required, and users can create workflows of any complexity.\n\nEach user's workflow is stored in a SlothyVault, which is deployed upon creation and isolates a single user's assets. The vaults interact with SlothyBlocks to execute a specific strategy. Each SlothyBlock is built to perform a single action.\n\nAutonomy Network takes care of executing the automation once certain conditions are met, as long as there is enough leftover gas token funded by the user during the setup process.\n\nSlothyFi is builder focused and everyone can contribute to the repository. Any project can build their integration on top of the Slothy Base Block by submitting their own bricks to the open-source repository. This approach makes the protocol modular and composable.\n\nOur goal for SlothyFi is to become the go-to app for custom yield automation, integrating as many DeFi lego bricks as possible. Apwine, Superfluid, and Aave are already partially integrated, and the library can be easily expanded. In the future, users will be able to copy and share workflows so that anyone can benefit from complex strategy automation.",

                        "fldOvrhmUwEiAhtPb": "The Company:\n\nCalyptus is a multi-chain learning & employment ecosystem solely dedicated to senior engineers.\n\nWhy are we different? We focus on senior engineers who have at least 4yrs experience. 90% of talent pipelines into Web3 are made up of junior engineers, yet there are 33x more job vacancies for seniors. Web3 desperately needs better leaders, managers and experienced builders for mass adoption, and we exist to fill that gap. \n\nHow are we different? We worked with the ex-Head of Education at NEAR Foundation, Sherif Abushadi, to design a platform purely based on Andragogy, adult learning theory, with 3 core pillars:\n\ni) Convenience: Senior engineers want convenience, independence & flexibility. Not bootcamps. We are a free, self-serve learning platform with on-demand Platform Navigators (DevRels) available via Office Hours or Slack 7-days a week. Jump into any part of the curriculum from Day 1. \n\nii) Relatability: Younger learners are malleable, older learners are less so. We consistently make links between a senior engineer’s existing knowledge base (JavaScript, Python, C++) and Solidity. This helps recognise bad habits and learn new best practices.\n\niii) Motivation: Younger builders are motivated by community-acceptance, immediate reward & career. Older builder motivations are: career, longer-term reward & personal interest. Learn-to-earn is not effective for seniors, but high-quality learning, projects & well-paid job opportunities are.\n\nWe believe The Web2 mantra of “Move Fast & Break Things” does not fit Web3. if you ship something with a single vulnerability, it cannot be reversed. We are completely values-based in our approach, centred around Responsibility & Care with a significant focus in Security Best Practice.\n\n\n—--------------------------------\n\nTraction:\n\nWe last applied to AaveGrants DAO in September 2022 but the application was declined with feedback outlining the DAO wanted to see some more traction. Since then, we have launched the platform (30th November) and made considerable traction within the industry.\n\ni) We have signed 17 employer clients totalling over 100 engineering vacancies. These employers include: Argent, SuperFluid, Zerion, Commonwealth Labs, Gelato Network, Cega, Request Finance, Nobank, Gateway.fm, Buildbear, Spanning Labs, Trust Protocol, ZK-Spark, Quetzal Fiannce & Naetion. \n\nii) AAVE Companies is our next client. We’ve had confirmation from the HR Director, Radostina Timcheva, that AAVE wishes to sign within the next few days. 7 out of 7 of their open engineering vacancies are for Senior roles and we're super excited to start helping fill some roles! Our service agreement is with the legal department.\n\niii) Since launch, we’ve had over 400 users sign-up from around the world including: 25% US, 25% Europe, 20% India, 30% rest of world. Our users on average have 9 yrs of engineering experience and come from tier-1 tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon & Revolut. With 0 marketing spend as yet, Calyptus is growing its user base at 15% week on week. \n\n\n—--------------------------------\n\nPlatform Features:\n\nThe Curriculum: teaches Solidity programming and is made up of 10 modules (3 beginner, 7 advanced) across Security, DeFi & NFTs. It’s broken down into written theory, walk-through recorded tutorials, and coding assessments/projects. It's been curated by industry leader, Eoin Connolly, the ex-technical director of Consensys.\n\nThe Virtual Calendar: packed with 3 different types of events: Engage (talks with Web3 Employers & Leaders), Meet (meet your peers, virtual drinks, find a co-founder), Learn (twice weekly drop-in sessions with our Platform Navigators like Office Hours, where our users can get unstuck in the curriculum and join open Q&As).\n\nThe Slack Community: asynchronous communication all via Slack where the engineers can interact with each other, get help from our Platform Navigators and speak to employers (ask questions, schedule interviews, land jobs). Online and operational 7 days a week.\n\nThe Employment Portal: where our users can discover various Engineering job opportunities, from Solidity Engineer to Senior Front-end Engineer, posted by our Web3 employer partners. Users can even jump into the employer’s profiles where they can learn in-depth about their mission, team & culture. From the specific modules the employer most cares about in our curriculum, to watching video walk-throughs of their product, and understanding their diversity & inclusion efforts.\n\n—------------------------------------\n\nThe Project:\n\nWe are seeking $15,000 in Aave Grant funding to i) build a comprehensive set of modules around Aave, specifically for advanced learners, and ii) be an educational & onboarding on-ramp for Aave Companies. The funding will be used to create 6 high-quality videos & video scripts with Sherif Abushadi (ex-Head of Education, NEAR) and Miguel Martinez (Blockchain Engineer, Aave).\n\nOur goal is to develop a free, in-depth syllabus comprising 3 modules: Beginners, Advanced and V3 Updates. They will cover the Aave protocol and all of its features, instructing our learners on how to utilise DeFi and open the door to limitless possibilities for a financial system accessible to everyone.\n\n1) For the Beginners module, it will be broken down into 2 tutorials: Written theory & Project. For the theory, we want to create a 45 min video covering the nuts and bolts of Aave's protocol including: Aavenomics, Risk, Lending, and Borrowing. \n\nFor the Project, a 1hr walk-through video on building your own Funds Lottery Pool, scripted by Miguel Martinez. Learners will pool their money together, lend it on Aave and see first-hand how they might earn interest on their funds.\n\n2) We would like to develop an Advanced module focused on Flash Loans and Gas Optimisation. 3 tutorials in total: 2 x 1hr walk-through videos on Flash Loans & 1 x 1hr on Gas Optimisation best practice with Sherif Abushadi.\n\nFor Flash Loans, our learners will build two specific projects around:\n\ni) Liquidation Calls. Educating our learners on how they can help and participate in the health of the overall protocol, by acting in their own interest and ensuring borrowers are sufficiently collateralized.\n\nii) A smart contract that uses Flash Loans to swap tokens. For keeping prices aligned and earnings on the positive arbitrages, we will also focus on the importance of Gas Optimization & fees calculations.\n\n(This will additionally help teach our learners why the community of users surrounding DeFi is critical for keeping the protocol stable and strong for preserving integrity)\n\nRegarding Gas Optimisation, we want to create a 1hr video production on tips & best practices. We will also underline best practices followed by Aave regarding Audits and Formal Verification of their smart contracts.\n\n3) Lastly, V3 Updates, we aim to create a 1hr video production covering: Capital Efficiency, Isolation Mode, Multichain Portals, Efficiency Mode, Risk Management, Multiple Rewards, and Aave on Layer 2\n\n\nThe Syllabus Outline:\n\nBASIC\nAavenomics\nRisk\nLending\nBorrowing\nInterfaces\nPROJECT: Calyptus Founds Lottery Pool\n\nADVANCED\nFlash Loans\nFL for Liquidations\nFL for Swapping\nGovernance\nAave Smart Contracts\nGas Optimization\nFees calculation\nPROJECT 1: Liquidation Calls BOT (using Flash Loans)\nPROJECT 2: Tokens Swapping (using Flash Loans)\n\nAAVE V3 UPDATES\nCapital Efficiency\nIsolation Mode\nMultichain Portals\nEfficiency Mode\nRisk Management\nMultiple Rewards\nAave on Layer 2\n",

Our findings would then be published in long-form format, Twitter threads, as well as in media formats such as podcasts and social media video clips, by FranklinDAO.\n\nThe first part of our analysis would be a quantitative and qualitative dive into how Aave works. This would begin with a high-level overview of the history, goals, and basic functionality of Aave, before launching into a rigorous explanation that explores each detail of functionality. Quantitative details through on-chain analysis and data oracles like Dune would provide additional support to the impact of Aave and the design choices made by developers. The goal of this section is to go beyond the original white paper by providing an additional analysis of how design choices, such as aTokens, have shaped out in practice once deployed on-chain. \n\nThe second part of our analysis would be a gaze into the future of Aave. We would give recommendations for areas of improvement in future versions of Aave and findings for how Aave fits into the broader picture of Web3—in particular, how it is important to trends and innovations in the spotlight at the moment, such as scrutiny around Centralized Exchanges and whether or not an Aave-specific chain is possible. This portion of our analysis is slightly more subjective, and we would tailor it to highlight the strengths of members of our research team. For example, in the past, we have produced debate-style research on the philosophy whether or not Decentralized Finance can exist without any centralized players; this is something that we could connect to the future of Aave and the unique interest rates it offers.\n\nThe final section of our project is releasing the publication in a variety of media formats to maximize the traction that it gains. Like our previous research, we typically release in the format of a long-form piece, twitter thread, podcast, and social media clips. These are published by our FranklinDAO accounts, as well as the accounts of our individual researchers. ",

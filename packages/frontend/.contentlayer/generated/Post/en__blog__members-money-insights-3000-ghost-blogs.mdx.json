    "raw": "\nWith my blog, felixvemmer.com, on the cusp of reaching its first 100 members, my curiosity about the expansive Ghost blog ecosystem was piqued.\n\n- How does my blog stand amidst the thousands out there?\n- Which topics are bloggers most passionate about?\n- Who's truly mastering the art of engagement and monetization?\n\nTo answer these questions, I plunged into the depths of the Ghost Explore dataset. Through this exploration, I've unveiled a myriad of insights—from dominant blogging categories and membership dynamics to the fascinating world of Ghost blog monetization. If you're eager to unravel the captivating stories this data holds, come along on this analytical odyssey through the Ghost blog universe.\n\n## Unraveling the Ghost Explore Dataset\n\nWhen I stumbled upon [Ghost Explore](https://ghost.org/explore/?ref=felixvemmer.com), I found a goldmine. It's not just a directory; it's the heart of the Ghost creator network, a platform that bridges creators and readers, helping them discover their next favorite publication. Ghost Explore is more than a listing—it's a showcase of the Ghost ecosystem's vastness, featuring sites based on their popularity, engagement metrics, and more. And guess what? Anyone with a Ghost site (running version 5.8 or higher) can join this community, sharing their data and getting their moment in the spotlight.\n\n<Image\n  className=\"mt-4 rounded-lg\"\n  src=\"/posts/members-money-insights-3000-ghost-blogs/CleanShot-2023-09-16-at-12.14.41@2x.png\"\n  alt=\"My Blog on Ghost Explore\"\n  width={800}\n  height={600}\n/>\n\n## Exploring the Dataset\n\nDiving into the dataset from Ghost Explore, it's important to note that this is just a sample of all Ghost blogs out there. Yet, the insights are revealing:\n\n1. **Total Blogs Analyzed:** I looked at a substantial sample of 2,985 **Ghost blogs** from across the globe.\n2. **Diverse Themes:** These blogs span across **34 unique categories**, reflecting a broad spectrum of interests and niches.\n3. **Average Membership:** For the blogs that shared their numbers, the average membership is approximately **1,847 members** (from a sample of 1,266 blogs).\n4. **Revenue Patterns:** The average Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for these disclosing blogs is around **$2,501** (from a sample of 155 blogs).\n\nRemember, these averages are **specific to the blogs that chose to share their details**. The true averages across all Ghost blogs might differ.\n\nWith this foundation laid, let's dig deeper to uncover more specific trends, highlight top performers, and understand intriguing patterns from this dataset.\n\n## Dominant Categories in the Ghost Blogging Landscape\n\nAmong the diverse categories captured in the dataset, certain themes clearly resonate more with the Ghost blogging community. **Technology** remains the frontrunner, with 674 blogs centered around tech-centric themes, innovations, and insights. **Business** holds its ground with 324 blogs that delve into strategies, market trends, and entrepreneurial narratives. **Personal** tales and experiences span 179 blogs, providing intimate insights and reflections. Rounding off the top five are **Culture** and **Education**, hosting 162 and 150 blogs, respectively. This distribution paints a vivid picture of the Ghost blogging community's diverse interests and highlights the subjects currently resonating with readers.\n\n<Image\n  className=\"mt-4 rounded-lg\"\n  src=\"/posts/members-money-insights-3000-ghost-blogs/GbyT8-top-5-categories-dominating-the-ghost-blogging-landscape (1).png\"\n  alt=\"My Blog on Ghost Explore\"\n  width={800}\n  height={600}\n/>\n\n## Memberships: Ghost's Game-Changer and Your Next Insight\n\nOne of Ghost's standout features is its ability to **effortlessly convert readers into members**. Instead of mere views, you get a community. It's this very feature that has allowed countless Ghost blogs to thrive and create meaningful connections.\n\nAs for me? I cherish every member of my community. If you've found value in this analysis and are curious about more insights, consider hitting the 'Subscribe' button below.\n\nWith the stage set, let's turn our attention back to the data. What does the membership landscape look like across these Ghost blogs? Which blogs are leading the pack, and what strategies might they be employing? Prepare for some eye-opening member insights from the Ghost blogging realm.\n\n### Broad Adoption: Trust in Ghost’s Features\n\nA significant chunk of the Ghost blogging community has embraced the platform's membership capabilities. Out of the blogs analyzed, **1,267 have chosen to disclose their member counts**. This openness not only reflects their trust in Ghost but also highlights the platform's ability to foster genuine community engagement.\n\n### Sky-High Memberships: The Pinnacle of Engagement\n\nThe '[Inspire](https://inspire.savee.it/?ref=ghost-explore)' blog stands as a testament to what's achievable with Ghost, boasting an awe-inspiring **379,000 members**. Such numbers demonstrate the profound reach and impact a dedicated Ghost blog can command in the digital realm.\n\nA table displaying the 20 most subscribed Ghost blogs, ranked by their member count. Each entry provides the blog title and the respective number of members.\n\n<Image\n  className=\"mt-4 rounded-lg\"\n  src=\"/posts/members-money-insights-3000-ghost-blogs/UPC8F-top-20-ghost-blogs-by-member-count-.png\"\n  alt=\"Top 20 most subscribed Ghost blogs, ranked by their member count\"\n  width={800}\n  height={600}\n/>\n\n### Starting Out: Humble Beginnings\n\nEvery community begins somewhere. In our dataset, **333 blogs have 10 or fewer members**. These numbers are a gentle reminder that even the most expansive communities might have once started small, cherishing every new member who joined their ranks.\n\n### A Balanced Perspective: The Median Tale\n\nPeeling back the layers reveals a more balanced Ghost blog landscape. A **median member count of 67 suggests** that while some blogs enjoy vast audiences, many thrive with smaller, more intimate communities.\n\n#### Collective Power: The Ghost Community's Cumulative Strength\n\nWhen we aggregate the numbers, it's clear that Ghost bloggers have created a substantial digital footprint. Collectively, they've engaged a **staggering total of 2,339,457 members**. To offer some perspective, that's akin to a small country's population, all woven together through the Ghost platform.\n\nAnd while the \"Technology\" category boasts the highest number of blogs, it's the **\"Productivity\" niche that leads in terms of member engagement**. This discrepancy sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of content preference and audience interaction within the Ghost community.\n\nA table showcasing the 20 most popular categories among Ghost blogs, ranked based on their cumulative member count. Each entry lists the category name and its respective total members.\n\n<Image\n  className=\"mt-4 rounded-lg\"\n  src=\"/posts/members-money-insights-3000-ghost-blogs/H4HSI-top-20-ghost-blog-categories-ranked-by-member-count.png\"\n  alt=\"Top 20 Ghost Blog Categories Ranked by Member Count\"\n  width={800}\n  height={600}\n/>\n\n## Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): A Closer Look\n\nA segment of the Ghost blogging community has tapped into the platform's potential to monetize their content. Of the analyzed blogs, only 155 have shared their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) details.\n\n### Raking in the Revenue: The Gold Standards\n\nCertain blogs have truly mastered the art of monetization. For instance, '[Product Marketing Alliance](https://www.productmarketingalliance.com/?ref=felixvemmer.com)' stands out with an MRR that many could only dream of: **a staggering $110,000**. It's an exemplary demonstration of the financial success one can achieve through dedicated blogging on Ghost.\n\n> PMA is the new standard of excellence to help product marketers lead their product lines and companies to the next level.\n\n<Image\n  className=\"mt-4 rounded-lg\"\n  src=\"/posts/members-money-insights-3000-ghost-blogs/yXETu-top-20-ghost-blogs-by-monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr-.png\"\n  alt=\"Top 20 Ghost Blogs by Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)\"\n  width={800}\n  height={600}\n/>\n\n### Starting Small: Every Penny Counts\n\nIt's not all about six-figure revenues. Several blogs in our dataset, **precisely 43 of them, have an MRR of $10 or less**. These figures highlight the early stages of monetization, reminiscent of the initial steps of many now-flourishing blogs.\n\n#### A Balanced Revenue Perspective: The Median MRR\n\nWhen we sift through the numbers, the Ghost blogging community showcases a varied revenue landscape. **The median MRR stands at $45**, suggesting a balance between high-earning blogs and those still finding their financial footing.\n\n#### Collective Earnings: Ghost's Economic Impact\n\nCumulatively, **Ghost bloggers have generated a remarkable MRR of $387,610**. This collective earning is a testament to Ghost's transformative impact on content creators' livelihoods. And while the \"Technology\" category might house the most blogs, categories like **\"Finance\" truly shine when it comes to average MRR,** offering insights into the most lucrative niches.\n\nA table displaying the top 11 content categories on Ghost blogs, ranked by their cumulative Monthly Recurring Revenue. Each entry lists the category name and its total MRR in dollars.\n\n<Image\n  className=\"mt-4 rounded-lg\"\n  src=\"/posts/members-money-insights-3000-ghost-blogs/3yqDo-top-11-categories-by-monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr-on-ghost.png\"\n  alt=\"Top 11 Categories by Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) on Ghost\"\n  width={800}\n  height={600}\n/>\n\n## Harnessing Open PageRank for Insights\n\nOpen PageRank brings back the crucial metric of website authority, drawing from extensive open-source data. By incorporating it into our Ghost blog analysis, we gain a deeper understanding of their online visibility and influence.\n\n**Quick Open PageRank Stats**:\n\n- **Total Blogs with PageRank data:** 1,540\n- **PageRank Range:** 73 to 324,686,980\n- **Median PageRank:** 16,235,864.5\n\n### Top 10 Ghost Blogs by Open PageRank\n\n1.

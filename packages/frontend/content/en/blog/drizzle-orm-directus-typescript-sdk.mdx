[Directus](https://directus.io/?ref=felixvemmer.com) is packed with features we all love, but there's been a missing piece: TypeScript support when querying data. That's where [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/?ref=felixvemmer.com) comes in. In this article, we'll explore how using Drizzle ORM with Directus can make our development process even better and solve the TypeScript challenge.

## Exploring TypeScript Support in the Directus JavaScript SDK

The Directus [JavaScript SDK](https://docs.directus.io/guides/sdk/getting-started.html?ref=felixvemmer.com#features) boasts a notable commitment to TypeScript, highlighting its dedication to offering developers a "TypeScript first" experience. This pledge is evident when we see the enticing feature tag:

> **TypeScript first:** The SDK provides a robust and type-safe development experience

It's clear that Directus aims to ensure developers can work seamlessly with TypeScript.

However, when delving further into the SDK's documentation, we encounter:

> If using TypeScript, you need to provide a `Schema` when creating a Directus client to make use of type hinting and completion. This schema contains definitions for each collection and provides you with type hints (on input) and completion (on output).

This means developers are tasked with implementing the schema themselves.

```typescript
import { createDirectus } from '@directus/sdk'
import { graphql } from '@directus/sdk/graphql'
import { rest } from '@directus/sdk/rest'

interface Article {
  id: number
  title: string
  content: string
}

interface Schema {
  articles: Article[]
}

// Client with REST support
const client = createDirectus<Schema>('http://directus.example.com').with(rest())

// Client with GraphQL support
const client = createDirectus<Schema>('http://directus.example.com').with(graphql())
```

### The Challenge of Manual Schema Implementation

While Directus offers a systematic approach to integrating TypeScript, there's a clear challenge: **manual schema implementation**.

For developers who thrive on efficiency, creating and updating the schema by hand, especially for larger projects with numerous collections, can become a **time-consuming task**.

Let's consider the process: for each collection in Directus, a corresponding TypeScript interface has to be crafted, ensuring that it matches the data structure in Directus precisely. This not only demands **meticulous attention to detail but also a significant investment of time**, especially when modifications are made to the Directus collections.

It's not that manual implementations are inherently problematic, but in an era where automation and seamless workflows are prized, there's certainly room for improvement. And while Directus's "TypeScript first" approach is commendable, the **manual schema aspect does leave a few developers wishing for a more streamlined experience**.

So, where do we go from here? Instead of resigning ourselves to the manual grind, let's explore some alternatives that can make our TypeScript journey with Directus smoother and more efficient.

## Harnessing Automation for Schema Generation

Navigating the manual intricacies of schema implementation can be cumbersome, but the developer landscape is vast, with many tools and methods at our disposal. The ideal approach **would be to strike a balance between automation and precision**, ensuring that we maintain the integrity of our data while speeding up the development process. In our quest for a more efficient TypeScript journey with Directus, let's delve into a promising option that can provide the solution we're after.

### Option 1: ChatGPT-Assisted Schema Creation

### Why I Chose Drizzle ORM Over Others

Making a decision among a slew of good options is never straightforward. However, certain standout features and benefits can tip the balance. For my project, Drizzle ORM emerged as the frontrunner, and here's why:

1. **Instant Schema Generation:** The true power of an ORM or a development tool often lies in the time it saves. Drizzle ORM’s `drizzle-kit introspect:{dialect}` command is a testament to this. With just a quick command, I was able to pull the Data Definition Language (DDL) from my existing database and generate the required `schema.ts` file in a snap. This meant not only TypeScript interfaces but also Zod models were ready in mere seconds.
2. **Direct Database Access:** One of the most significant advantages Drizzle ORM offers is its independence from the Directus server. Instead of routing my queries through Directus, I can communicate directly with the database. This direct approach makes it lightweight and perfect for edge deployments, ensuring speed and efficiency.
3. **Intuitive Query Syntax:** We all have our preferences when it comes to coding syntax. With the traditional JavaScript SDK for Directus, I often found myself navigating through nested and sometimes convoluted structures. Drizzle ORM, on the other hand, empowers me with familiar SQL dialects, all while maintaining top-notch type safety. This combo not only feels natural but also streamlines the development process, making it more enjoyable and efficient.

For context, let's first look at an implementation using the Directus SDK v11. Shortly, we'll compare it to a in my opionen more streamlined version.

```typescript
const PagesIdSchema = z.object({
  content: z.array(ContentSchema),
  seo: z.number(),
})

const PagesTranslationsSchema = z
  .array(
    z.object({
      id: z.number(),
      languages_code: z.string(),
      slug: z.string(),
      pages_id: PagesIdSchema,
    }),
  )
  .min(1)

type getPageDataParams = {
  slug: string
  lang: string
}

// Cache function for fetching page data
export const getPageData = cache(async (params: getPageDataParams) => {
  const { slug, lang } = params

  const { data } = await directus.items('pages_translations').readByQuery({
    fields: ['*', 'pages_id.content.collection', 'pages_id.content.item', 'pages_id.seo'],
    filter: {
      _and: [
        {
          languages_code: {
            _starts_with: lang,
          },
        },
        {
          slug: {
            _eq: slug,
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  })

  const pages = PagesTranslationsSchema.parse(data)

  const [page] = pages

  return page
})
```

## Implementing Drizzle ORM with Directus Collections

Successfully marrying Drizzle ORM with Directus Collections can amplify your development experience manifold. This combination lets you leverage the amazing interface of Directus while tapping into the power-packed features of Drizzle ORM. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started.

### Step 1: Setting Up Directus Models

Your Directus models, or Collections as they're often referred to, serve as the blueprint for your content and dictate how data should be structured within your Directus instance. I set up these models:

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/drizzle-orm-directus-typescript-sdk/CleanShot-2023-09-17-at-11.20.40@2x.png"
  alt="Directus Data Models"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

And here are the most important models in more detail:

  alt="Blogpost Categories Model"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

### Step 2: Setting Up Drizzle ORM Database Connection

Connecting Drizzle ORM to your database is a pivotal step in our journey. This connection will be the bridge that facilitates all interactions between your Directus models and the underlying database, empowering you with direct, type-safe querying capabilities.

#### Creating the Configuration File

Firstly, let's set up a configuration file for Drizzle ORM, which I've named `directus-drizzle.config.ts`. You can place this file within your project's structure, I placed mine in the frontend package:

📂 `path`: `packages/frontend/directus-drizzle.config.ts`

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit'

// Load environment variables from '.env.local'
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' })

// Validate presence of the required DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL environment variable
if (!process.env.DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL) {
  throw new Error('DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL is missing')
}

console.log('DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL', process.env.DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL)

// Export the configuration for Drizzle ORM
export default {
  out: './directus-drizzle',
  dbCredentials: {
    connectionString: process.env.DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL,
  },
  driver: 'pg',
} as Config
```

In this configuration:

- We're using the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from `.env.local`.
- The connection string is sourced from an environment variable named `DIRECTUS_DIRECT_URL`.
- The driver specified here is for a PostgreSQL database (`pg`). Ensure this matches your database type.

For a deeper dive into configuration options and understanding the full capabilities of Drizzle ORM configurations, I highly recommend checking the official Drizzle ORM documentation, especially the section detailing configurations: [Drizzle ORM Configuration Documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/conf?ref=felixvemmer.com).

This setup ensures that Drizzle ORM is finely tuned to interact with your database, respecting the structures you've defined in Directus and facilitating efficient, type-safe operations.

### Step 3: Creating the Schema

Generating and maintaining a schema for your database is crucial. When working with Directus and Drizzle, this process becomes streamlined, allowing for quick introspection and schema creation from your database. Let's break down how this is accomplished:

#### 1. Package.json Scripts:

Within our `package.json` file, we have defined three scripts for schema management:

```typescript
{
  "scripts": {
    "introspect-drizzle": "drizzle-kit introspect:pg --config=directus-drizzle.config.ts",
    "fix-directus-schema": "node fix-directus-schema.js",
    "introspect-fix-directus": "pnpm introspect-drizzle && pnpm fix-directus-schema"
  }
}
```

- **introspect-drizzle**: Uses the [Drizzle introspection command](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands?ref=felixvemmer.com#introspect--pull) to generate a schema based on the Directus PostgreSQL database.
- **fix-directus-schema**: Invokes a script to correct minor issues within the generated schema.
- **introspect-fix-directus**: This combined script first introspects the database to generate a schema and then applies fixes. It's ideal to include this in your build step.

#### 2. Correcting Schema Generation Issues:

While the introspection process is robust, you might encounter minor issues with the generated schema. We address these with the `fix-directus-schema.js` script:

```typescript
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')

const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'directus-drizzle', 'schema.ts')

fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading the file:', err)
    return
  }

  let newData = data.replace(/::character varying/g, '')
  newData = newData.replace(/\.default\(NULL\)/g, '')

  fs.writeFile(filePath, newData, 'utf8', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error writing to the file:', err)
      return
    }

    console.log('Replacements were successful!')
  })
})
```

Script to fix minor schema generation issues.

This script modifies the generated schema by making certain replacements to correct minor discrepancies.

### Step 4: Creating the Drizzle Client

Once the database connection is set up, the next logical step in our journey is creating a client to handle database operations through Drizzle ORM. This client will act as the main interface for all our database-related tasks, leveraging the power of Drizzle ORM while working harmoniously with the Directus configurations we've established.

#### Setting Up the Client

To do this, I created a file named `directus.ts` located in the frontend's `src/lib` directory:

📂 `path`: `packages/frontend/src/lib/directus.ts`

```typescript
import * as schema from '@../directus-drizzle/schema'
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless'

// Validate the presence of the required DIRECTUS_DATABASE_URL environment variable
const connectionString = process.env.DIRECTUS_DATABASE_URL
if (!connectionString) {
  throw new Error('DIRECTUS_DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set')
}

// Initialize a new connection pool
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DIRECTUS_DATABASE_URL })

// Create and export the Drizzle client
export const directus = drizzle(pool, {
  schema: {
    ...schema,
  },
})
```

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

- We're utilizing the `@neondatabase/serverless` package to set up a connection pool. This provides a managed set of database connections that can be used for executing queries, ensuring efficient database communication.
- The connection string is fetched from the `DIRECTUS_DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which must be set beforehand.
- The Drizzle client is then initialized using the connection pool and the schema we defined earlier. This client will be the core tool you use to query and manipulate your data using Drizzle ORM.

By the end of this step, you have a robust Drizzle client ready to go, backed by a sturdy database connection.

### Step 5: Fetching Data - A Practical Example

As we progress, understanding how to harness the combined power of Directus and Drizzle ORM to fetch data becomes critical. Let's delve into a concrete example to fetch and display data for a blog post page.

Here's an example that illustrates the process:

```typescript
import { DirectusImage } from '@components/directus/directus-image'
import { RenderBlocks } from '@components/directus/render-blocks'
import { FireIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
import { directus } from '@lib/directus'
import { format } from 'date-fns'
import {
  blogpostCategories as _blogpostCategories,
  authors,
  blogposts,
  blogpostsBlogpostCategories,
  blogpostsContent
} from 'directus-drizzle/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function BlogTestPage({ params: { slug } }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  // Fetching the blog post data and its associated author
  const blogpostsData = await directus
    .select()
    .from(blogposts)
    .innerJoin(authors, eq(blogposts.author, authors.id))
    .where(eq(blogposts.slug, slug))
    .where(eq(blogposts.status, 'published'))

  if (!blogpostsData.length) notFound()

  const { blogposts: blogpost, authors: author } = blogpostsData[0]

  // Fetching the categories associated with the blog post
  const blogpostCategories = await directus
    .select({
      name: _blogpostCategories.name,
    })
    .from(_blogpostCategories)
    .innerJoin(
      blogpostsBlogpostCategories,
      eq(blogpostsBlogpostCategories.blogpostCategoriesId, _blogpostCategories.id),
    )
    .where(eq(blogpostsBlogpostCategories.blogpostsId, blogpost.id))

  // Fetching content data associated with the blog post
  const blogpostContentData = await directus
    .select({
      item: blogpostsContent.item,
      collection: blogpostsContent.collection,
    })
    .from(blogpostsContent)
    .where(eq(blogpostsContent.blogpostsId, blogpost.id))

  return (
    // ... Rendered JSX components ...
  )
}
```

#### What's happening in the code above?

1. **Fetching Blog Post Data:** We start by making an inner join between the `blogposts` and `authors` tables. We're interested in blog posts that match a certain `slug` and have a status of `'published'`.
2. **Fetching Associated Categories:** We then retrieve the categories associated with the blog post. We make use of inner joins to combine data from the `blogpostCategories` and `blogpostsBlogpostCategories` tables.
3. **Fetching Content Data:** Finally, we fetch content data related to our blog post, leveraging the `blogpostsContent` table.
4. **Rendering:** After fetching all the required data, we use JSX to structure and present the data on the page.

This example underscores the simplicity and power that Drizzle ORM brings to the table. By crafting precise queries, we're able to seamlessly integrate our Directus collections with the application, ensuring a dynamic and efficient content delivery system.

In the next section, we'll delve into the "many-2-any" field, focusing on our content. We will explore how we can effectively render these blocks, ensuring our data is showcased in the best possible manner. Stay tuned!

### Step 6: Rendering Dynamic Blocks with Directus and Drizzle ORM

A powerful feature of content management systems (CMS) like Directus is the capability to define dynamic content blocks, which can be conditionally rendered based on data and logic. This flexibility ensures that content creators and developers can model and present data in a versatile and modular manner. Let's dive into how you can set up and render these dynamic content blocks using Directus and Drizzle ORM.

#### 1. render-blocks Component

Our first order of business is to define a React component, `render-blocks.tsx`, which will be responsible for rendering each block based on its type:

```typescript
import { FC } from 'react'
import { BlockImage } from './block-image'
import { BlockRichText } from './block-richtext'

export interface RenderBlocksProps {
  blocks: {
    item: string | null
    collection: string | null
  }[]
}
export const RenderBlocks: FC<RenderBlocksProps> = ({ blocks }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {blocks.map((block, index) => {
        if (block.item === null || block.collection === null) {
          return null
        }

        const { collection, item } = block

        switch (collection) {
          case 'block_image':
            return <BlockImage item={item} key={index} />
          // Add more cases as needed
          case 'block_rich_text':
            return <BlockRichText item={item} key={index} />
          default:
            console.error(`Block type ${block.collection} is not implemented.`)
            return null
        }
      })}
    </>
  )
}
```

#### 2. Implementing Block Components

Next, we create separate React components for each block type:

- `block-richtext.tsx`: Displays rich text content, which can encompass formatted text, hyperlinks, and other HTML elements.

```typescript
import { directus } from '@lib/directus'
import { blockRichText as _blockRichText } from 'directus-drizzle/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { FC } from 'react'

export interface BlockRichTextProps {
  item: string
}
export const BlockRichText: FC<BlockRichTextProps> = async ({ item }) => {
  const blockRichTextData = await directus
    .select()
    .from(_blockRichText)
    .where(eq(_blockRichText.id, item))

  if (blockRichTextData.length === 0) notFound()

  const blockRichText = blockRichTextData[0]

  const { richText } = blockRichText

  if (!richText) {
    throw new Error('Rich Text cannot be null')
  }

  return (
    <>
      {/* <pre>{JSON.stringify(blockRichText, null, 2)}</pre> */}
      <div
        className="prose pb-8 lg:prose-xl"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: richText,
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

- `block-image.tsx` : This component fetches and displays an image from Directus.

```typescript
import { FC } from 'react'
import { DirectusImage } from './directus-image'
import { directus } from '@lib/directus'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { directusFiles, blockImage as _blockImage } from 'directus-drizzle/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'

export interface BlockImageProps {
  item: string
}
export const BlockImage: FC<BlockImageProps> = async ({ item }) => {
  const directusFilesData = await directus
    .select({
      directusFiles,
    })
    .from(_blockImage)
    .innerJoin(directusFiles, eq(_blockImage.image, directusFiles.id))
    .where(eq(_blockImage.id, item))

  if (!directusFilesData.length) notFound()

  const image = directusFilesData[0].directusFiles

  //   return <pre>{JSON.stringify(image, null, 2)}</pre>

  return <DirectusImage fileId={image.id} />
}
```

#### 3. Image Helper Function

To streamline the process of fetching image metadata from Directus, we employ a helper function, `getDirectusImageUrl`. This function retrieves crucial data such as image URL, dimensions, and title.

```typescript
import { directus } from '@lib/directus'
import { directusFiles } from 'directus-drizzle/schema'
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'

export async function getDirectusImageUrl({ fileId }: { fileId: string }): Promise<{
  url: string
  height: number
  width: number
  title: string | null
}> {
  const directusFilesData = await directus
    .select()
    .from(directusFiles)
    .where(eq(directusFiles.id, fileId))

  if (!directusFilesData.length) throw new Error('No image found')

  const image = directusFilesData[0]

  const { height, width, title, filenameDisk } = image

  if (!filenameDisk) {
    throw new Error('Filename Disk cannot be null')
  }

  if (typeof height !== 'number' || typeof width !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('Height and Width must be of type string')
  }

  const s3Url = `https://directus-backlinkgpt.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/${filenameDisk}`

  return {
    url: s3Url,
    height,
    width,
    title,

With this helper, fetching image data becomes seamless, enabling us to efficiently render images using the `directus-image.tsx` component.

#### 4. Directus Image Component

The `diretus-image.tsx` component serves to render an image fetched from Directus, using Next.js's `Image` component for optimized image delivery:

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image'
import { FC } from 'react'
import { getDirectusImageUrl } from './image'

export interface DirectusImageProps {
  fileId: string
  className?: string
  layout?: 'intrinsic' | 'fixed' | 'responsive' | undefined
}
export const DirectusImage: FC<DirectusImageProps> = async ({ fileId, className, layout }) => {
  const { height, title, url, width } = await getDirectusImageUrl({ fileId })

  return (
    <>
      {/* <pre>{JSON.stringify(blockImage, null, 2)}</pre> */}
      <Image
        className={className ?? ''}
        src={url}
        alt={title ?? ''}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        layout={layout ?? 'intrinsic'}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

With the described setup, we've unlocked **a robust method to handle and render dynamic content blocks** with Directus and Drizzle ORM. This modular approach not only encapsulates logic for each block type but also facilitates future additions or modifications to the block types.

As you expand your project, simply create new block components and integrate them into the `render-blocks.tsx` component. This system is scalable, maintainable, and harnesses the full potential of Directus as a CMS alongside Drizzle ORM's capabilities.

### Empowering Development: The Synergy of Directus and Drizzle

As we journeyed through the intricate world of Directus and Drizzle, it's evident that when paired together, these tools can truly elevate your TypeScript development process. By streamlining database operations and seamlessly connecting TypeScript objects with database entries, we can **craft applications that are both robust and maintainable**.

The power of introspection, complemented by precise schema generation and maintenance techniques, allows for a **hassle-free and accurate reflection of our database structures in our codebase**. And although we might occasionally encounter minor roadblocks, as seen with the schema generation discrepancies, the community-driven nature of these platforms ensures there are solutions readily available.

In essence, Directus and Drizzle together offer a potent combination for developers aiming to **harness the benefits of a headless CMS with the predictability and type safety of TypeScript**. As you integrate these practices into your workflow, you'll find that they not only boost productivity but also ensure a more consistent and bug-free development experience.

Happy coding!

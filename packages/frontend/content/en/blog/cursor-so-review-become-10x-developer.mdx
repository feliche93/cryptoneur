When my friend and fellow indie hackerÂ [Perjan](https://twitter.com/PerjanDuro?ref=felixvemmer.com)Â fromÂ [MoneyCoach.ai](https://moneycoach.ai/?ref=felixvemmer.com)Â came to me with a challenge, I wasn't initially thrilled. He wanted a Next.js route that could convert a CSV file into a neat PDF table full of transactions. Working with CSVs and PDFs, with all the data twists and turns, can be tricky. But here's where it gets interesting:Â **usingÂ [**cursor.so**](https://www.cursor.so/?ref=felixvemmer.com), I conquered this task in just 1 hour and 45 minutes**. It was a defining moment for me, realising the power of cursor.so. Why am I so passionate about it? Let's dive intoÂ **why**Â **it's a tool every aspiring 10x developer should know about**.

## Top 5 Features of Cursor.so That Transformed My Coding Workflow

When I first tried cursor.so, I was amazed by all it could do. ButÂ **five features really stood out and changed the way I code**. They make hard tasks easier and help me get more done. Let's look at these top features withÂ **some real examples.**

### 1. No more Copy Pasta between VS code and Chat GPT

Switching back and forth between VS Code and the OpenAI Chat GPT-4 tabÂ **isn't just tediousâ€”it's a momentum killer**. The constant copying of code, toggling between tabs, and then returning can disrupt your flow, particularly when you're managing multiple code snippets.

WithÂ [cursor.so](https://www.cursor.so/?ref=felixvemmer.com), you can put an end to this juggling act. Now, **injecting your code directly into the Chat GPT window is as easy as hitting theÂ `CMD + L`Â shortcut**, all while staying within the comfort of VS Code. No more tab-hopping or relentless copying and pasting. It's seamless, efficient, and designed to keep your coding process beautifully streamlined.

  alt="Cursor.so add to chat"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

### 2. What's Better Than Pasting? Inline Edits with tracked Changes

With cursor.so, not only can you effortlessly send your code directly into a chat window, but you can also edit that code inline, streamlining the entire process.

The added convenience? Their brilliantly designed UI/UX. ItÂ **effortlessly logs each modification, allowing you to accept or revisit changes as you see fit**.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/cursor-so-review-become-10x-developer/CleanShot-2023-10-02-at-23.42.17.gif"
  alt="Cursor.so inline edits"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

<Callout className="my-4" icon={<Icons.lightBulb />}>
  As you can see from this example, it's just the perfect docstring and Python type anotation tool.
  Also works great for typescript functions, pydantic models etc. ðŸ¤“

### 3. Always up-to-date APIs with little to no halucination

If you're into the new Next.js 13 App Router and cool features like server components and server actions, you'll quickly notice that ChatGPT's training stops short. It meansÂ **ChatGPT doesn't really know about all these new updates and every suggestion is garbage**Â without pasted text from the docs.

In cursor this is much simpler. Copy the docs url and cursor.so will automatically index the page and use it as context when answering a question:

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/cursor-so-review-become-10x-developer/CleanShot-2023-10-02-at-23.58.27.gif"
  alt="Cursor.so docs indexing"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

What's more, you have theÂ **option to save these documents in a structured format**, ensuring you can reference them easily in the future.

  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/cursor-so-review-become-10x-developer/CleanShot-2023-10-03-at-00.01.15@2x.png"
  alt="Cursor.so Docs creation and selection"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

### 4. Comprehensive Code Access, Beyond Just Docs

Diving deeper than just reference documentation, cursor.soÂ **offers easy access to all your files in your project**. Whether it's a function from a side module, a snippet from a lesser-known script, or a piece of logic buried deep within the codebase, you canÂ **combine those in one chat window by easily tagging them with anÂ `@`**Â in the chat window.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/cursor-so-review-become-10x-developer/CleanShot-2023-10-03-at-13.55.49@2x.png"
  alt="Cursor.so Docs creation and selection"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

With this you can easily replicate complex logic but with all the needed context to get high quality output.

### 5. Quick Fixes for TypeScript and CLI Errors

Ran into a command line error? With cursor.so, it's easy. Just highlight the error and pop it into a chat window to get a solution.

  src="/posts/cursor-so-review-become-10x-developer/CleanShot-2023-10-03-at-13.59.49@2x.png"
  alt="Adding terminal errors to cursor.so chat"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

And again, we can easily tag the fileÂ `@next.config.js`Â to get a fix right away with the error:

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"

But there's a speedier method for addressing errors. Just hover over any issue â€” I frequently do this with TypeScript problems â€” and cursor.so immediately offers a solution:

## Cursor.so vs. ChatGPT and Copilot: Do You Need All Three?

For coding tasks, cursor.so has become indispensable. Its ease of use and elimination of constant app-switching streamline my workflow. Going back to previous methods? Hard to even imagine. Yet, I continue to pay for my ChatGPT subscription. It's invaluable for drafting applications, improving emails, fine-tuning blog entries, and so on. And the mobile version of ChatGPT is great for quick queries on the move.

I also used ChatGPT with Eleven Labs and Screen Studio to create awsesome product videos.

Copilot shines in quickly generating boilerplate code and handling repetitive logic. The interface suggests solutions which you can instantly integrate with a tap of theÂ `tab`Â key, bringing an immediacy that cursor.so hasn't quite achieved. It's this seamless integration that's noteworthy. However, its future in my coding arsenal is uncertain. While Copilot handles routine tasks like generating simple functions, cursor.so takes care of the heavier lifting. Time will show if there's room for both, or if one becomes the clear favorite.

## A New Dawn in Coding: Embracing the Future with cursor.so

Cursor.so has reshaped my coding experience with its blend of VSCode familiarity and AI efficiency. Its features, such as seamless integration with Chat GPT, inline edits with tracked changes, and up-to-date API knowledge, have streamlined and enhanced my workflow. While ChatGPT and Copilot offer specific benefits, cursor.so's comprehensive approach addresses both routine and complex coding needs. In the toolbox of a modern developer, it holds a special place, marrying convenience with capability.

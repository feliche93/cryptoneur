**Server vs. client side rendering. Illustration by Next.js**

When Next.js first emerged, it offered a revolutionary choice to developers: **render pages on the server or directly in the browser**, paving the way for a new era in web development.

<Callout className="my-4" title="Client Rendering vs Server Rendering" icon={<Icons.lightBulb />}>
  **Client Rendering** is when the **browser** generates and updates the web page using JavaScript,
  often leading to dynamic interactions. In contrast, **Server Rendering** has the **server** create
  the initial page, delivering a fully-formed page to the browser, which can provide quicker initial
  load times.
</Callout>

With the [introduction of Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13?ref=felixvemmer.com), the game
has changed even more. Developers can now **decide, on a component-by-component basis**, whether each
should be rendered on the server or the client. This fine-tuning ensures both optimal performance and
maximum flexibility.For a clearer picture of when to utilize each strategy, the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns?ref=felixvemmer.com) provides
an insightful table.

### Rendering Strategies in Next.js

Next.js provides **three primary rendering strategies**, each offering unique implications for SEO and performance:

1. **Static Rendering:** Here, pages are created at build time, cached, and distributed via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Thanks to its predictable nature and rapid load times, it's **perfect for content that doesn't change often**, like blog articles.
2. **Dynamic Rendering:** Pages get generated per user request, facilitating personalized content. While this offers **custom user experiences**, it might be a tad slower, potentially affecting SEO. However, with the right tweaks, optimal performance can be retained.
3. **Streaming:** The server progressively renders the UI in segments. This method can enhance perceived performance, allowing users to **engage with sections of a page even before the full content finishes rendering** — an absolute advantage for content that relies on slower data fetches.

At the latest Next.js 14 Conf Guillermo Rauch, CEO of Vercel, explained the different rendering strategies in more detail and announced the Preview of [Partial Rendering](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14#partial-prerendering-preview).

> We'd like to share a preview of Partial Prerendering — a compiler optimization for dynamic content with a fast initial static response — that we're working on for Next.js.

<YouTubeEmbed id="8q2q_820Sx4" params="start=2500" />

### Making the Right Choice: Edge and Node.js Runtimes

In the rapidly evolving world of Next.js, developers are presented yet with more choices that impact not just rendering but also the very foundation of performance and SEO. **Two core runtimes spearhead this offering**, each with distinct advantages in these areas.

- **Edge Runtime**: Tailored for blazing-fast global content delivery, the Edge runtime leverages distributed servers. Its edge (pun intended) lies in **immediate, low-latency user experiences**, which can greatly boost site performance and user engagement. While its speed is an SEO asset, its limited functional scope compared to Node.js might require developers to strike a balance based on content needs.
- **Node.js Runtime**: Standing as Next.js's bedrock, the Node.js runtime opens doors to an **expansive ecosystem and APIs**. While its boot time may lag behind Edge, it offers a depth of features that can significantly enhance site dynamics, which in turn can be crucial for SEO-rich content and complex web applications.

By **aligning runtime choice with your goals**, you can [optimize](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes?ref=felixvemmer.com) your Next.js project for both performance and search visibility.

### The Power of React Server Components

[React Server Components](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html?ref=felixvemmer.com) are pivotal in this new era, empowering Next.js developers to craft **UI components that render directly on the server**. This leads to significant SEO and performance benefits:

- **Efficient Data Fetching:** By bringing data retrieval closer to its source, it minimizes client requests and accelerates the fetch procedure.
- **Enhanced Security:** Ensures that sensitive details, like tokens and API keys, stay secure on the server.
- **Reduced Bundle Sizes:** By keeping large dependencies server-side, the client's JavaScript bundle size gets minimized — a blessing for users with slow internet or basic devices.
- **Optimized Initial Page Load:** Renders HTML on the server, letting users view content instantly, without waiting for client-side rendering.
- **SEO & Shareability Boost:** Offers search engines and social platforms fully-rendered HTML, improving indexing and content previews.

### Loading UI and Streaming: Next.js's Answer to Enhanced UX

In today's web landscape, user experience is king. Any delay in content loading can [diminish engagement or conversions](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/?ref=felixvemmer.com):

> Walmart found that for **every 1 second *improvement* *in page load time, conversions increased by 2*%.**

Recognizing this, Next.js introduced the `loading.js` convention, coupled with React Suspense, to deliver meaningful Loading UIs. This ensures **users see an immediate loading state** as the content for a specific route segment gets ready.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/why-next-js/CleanShot-2023-10-10-at-14.41.48.gif"
  alt="Loading demo in Next.js 14 App Playground"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

Streaming takes this up a notch. By sending UI fragments from the server as they become ready, **users
can start browsing parts of the page even before it finishes rendering**.

Integrated into the Next.js App Router, streaming improves both the initial page load and UIs that depend on slower data fetches. The outcome? **Prompt feedback for users, even on content-heavy pages like product reviews**.

With these tools at their disposal, developers can design both loading UIs and strategically stream route sections, **guaranteeing the best user experiences possible**.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/why-next-js/CleanShot-2023-10-10-at-14.45.44.gif"

It does not stop there. At its heart are the **Built-in Optimizations** which ensure that your images, fonts, and scripts are fine-tuned for an optimal user experience. These enhancements, specifically tailored for Core Web Vitals, ensure users get the best out of every visit.

### Optimizing Images with *`next/image`*

Images are a cornerstone of modern web design, often dictating user engagement and perception. Recognizing their pivotal role, the [Next.js `Image` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image?ref=felixvemmer.com) offers a slew of benefits tailored to enhance both performance and user experience:

- **Optimal Sizing**: Caters to diverse device displays by automatically serving correctly sized images.
- **Modern Formats**: Embraces cutting-edge image formats like WebP and AVIF, ensuring high quality at reduced file sizes.
- **Visual Stability**: Prevents disruptive layout shifts by ensuring images maintain their allocated space as they load.
- **Smart Loading**: Implements native browser lazy-loading, ensuring images are fetched only when they're about to enter the viewport.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Optional blur-up placeholders provide a smooth transition as images load.
- **Unparalleled Flexibility**: On-the-fly resizing is available, even for images hosted externally.

### Optimizing Third-Party Scripts with **_`next/script`_**

Third-party scripts, like Google Tag Manager, often adversely affect website performance, which can significantly impede SEO. Next.js addresses this concern with its [`next/script` module](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/script?ref=felixvemmer.com), providing developers with enhanced control and optimization. The main advantages of using `next/script` are:

- **Strategized Loading**: Tailor how and when scripts load, optimizing website speed.
- **Web Worker Offloading** (Experimental): Improve performance by offloading scripts from the main thread.

#### New Experimental Libary `@next/third-parties`

The experimental library @next/third-parties enhances performance and developer experience in Next.js applications by providing optimized integrations for popular third-party libraries. Key features include components for Google Tag Manager, Google Maps Embed, and YouTube Embed. To use, install the library with npm install @next/third-parties.

<YouTubeEmbed id="8q2q_820Sx4" params="start=5703" />

### Next.js's `next/link` Component: Transforming Web Navigation

Smooth navigation is at the heart of a positive user experience. The [`<Link>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link?ref=felixvemmer.com) in Next.js elevates this, making web applications feel instantaneous and user-centric. Here's why it's crucial:

- **Instant Loading**: With the power of prefetching, `<Link>` preemptively loads content even before a user clicks on it. This translates to virtually instantaneous route transitions, making waiting times almost non-existent.
- **Dynamic Linking**: The flexibility of `<Link>` stands out, especially when dealing with varying content. It effortlessly caters to dynamic segments, letting developers easily create links to pages with variable data, such as blog posts or product listings.
- **Efficiency**: Under the hood, `<Link>` employs strategies like partial rendering and in-memory caching. This ensures that only the necessary content updates, while previously fetched data is quickly retrieved from cache. The result is a snappy and resource-efficient site transition.

### Next.js Metadata API: Enhancing SEO and Web Shareability

Metadata is the invisible force behind web prominence, **driving search engine rankings and enhancing shareability across platforms**. Next.js offers a [robust Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata?ref=felixvemmer.com), allowing developers to effortlessly integrate these crucial data snippets. You can embed metadata through two streamlined avenues in Next.js:

1. **Config-based**: Simply export metadata objects from your layout or page files.

```javascript
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: '...',
  description: '...',
}

export default function Page() {}
```

1. **Function-based**: Use `generateMetadata` function to `fetch` metadata that requires dynamic values.

```javascript
export async function generateMetadata(
  { params, searchParams }: Props,
  parent: ResolvingMetadata
): Promise<Metadata> {
  // read route params
  const id = params.id

  // fetch data
  const product = await fetch(`https://.../${id}`).then((res) => res.json())

  // optionally access and extend (rather than replace) parent metadata
  const previousImages = (await parent).openGraph?.images || []

  return {
    title: product.title,
    openGraph: {
      images: ['/some-specific-page-image.jpg', ...previousImages],
    },
  }
}
```

**Key Benefits**:

- **Enhanced SEO**: Metadata bolsters search engine understanding and ranking of your content, ensuring it reaches its intended audience.
- **Improved Shareability**: Metadata, especially when dynamic images like Open Graph are used, makes your content more appealing and comprehensible when shared on social platforms.
- **Flexibility**: Whether you need static, unchanging metadata or dynamic, content-specific metadata, Next.js has you covered.
- **Automated Head Management**: With the API, Next.js autonomously generates the appropriate `<head>` elements, saving time and preventing mistakes.

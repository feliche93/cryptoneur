Do you find the idea of migrating auth from Supabase to Clerk.dev intimidating? Let me assure you, it's less complex than it seems. In this guide, we'll simplify the process and walk you through every step of the migration. With just a handful of slight code tweaks, you'll be on the fast track to integrating Clerk.dev. So, let's dive right in and demystify this process together with a comprehensive, easy-to-follow guide.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Clerk.dev Account

Navigate to the `User & Authentication` settings and select `Email, Phone, Username`. This is the stage where you'll want to ensure that the settings mirror those of your existing Supabase account.

<Callout className="my-4" variant={"destructive"} icon={<Icons.alertTriangle />}>
  If you use a **username** make sure that you first toggle the setting off in clerk, as the import
  without setting a username will throw an error.

</Callout>

## Step 2: Establishing Required Secrets as Environment Variables

In order to facilitate the creation of new users, we need to communicate with the [Create new User Endpoint](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users?ref=felixvemmer.com#operation/CreateUser). This can be accomplished by using our Clerk API Keys:

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src={
    '/posts/migrate-user-authentication-supabase-clerk-dev/CleanShot-2023-06-07-at-09.05.47@2x-1.png'
  }
  width={1600}
  height={1450}
  alt={'Getting Clerk.dev API KEYs'}
/>

Next, we'll store the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as a Python environment variable within the `.env` file, making it accessible from our script.

Lastly, we'll need to secure the database connection string from our existing Supabase instance. This can be achieved by storing it as an environment variable. You can retrieve this string from `Project Settings` > `Database`.

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/migrate-user-authentication-supabase-clerk-dev/CleanShot-2023-06-07-at-09.18.16@2x.png"
  width={1600}
  height={1188}
  alt={'Getting Supabase Connection URI'}
/>

Our final `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="{YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY}"
PSQL_CONNECTION_STRING="{YOUR_SUPABSE_PSQL_CONNECTION_STRING}"
```

## Step 3: Preparing the Migration Script

In the following I will show you how I set up my migration script. Feel free to edit and adjust the parts that will be slightly different for you.

### Setting up env and imports

To get started we will import the following libraries and set up our environment variables form a `.env` file:

```python
import os
import psycopg2
import psycopg2.extras  # Import for RealDictCursor
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import requests
import time
from tqdm import tqdm  # For the progress bar


load_dotenv(
    dotenv_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), ".env.local"),
    override=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

<Callout variant={'destructive'} icon={<Icons.alertTriangle />}>
  Make sure to adjust the `.env.local` and path to your env file.
</Callout>

### Connecting to Supabase and fetching all Users

Next we connect to the instance and run the a sql query to get all the users:

```python
# Get the connection string from the environment variable
connection_string = os.getenv("PSQL_CONNECTION_STRING")

# Connect to the PostgreSQL database
conn = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)

# Create a cursor object using RealDictCursor
cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.RealDictCursor)

sql_query = """
WITH user_data AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        email,
        encrypted_password,
        created_at,
        username
    FROM auth.users
    LEFT JOIN usernames ON usernames.user_id = users.id
),
user_profiles AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        first_name,
        last_name
    FROM public.profiles
)
SELECT
    user_data.id::TEXT AS external_id,
    user_data.username,
    user_profiles.first_name,
    user_profiles.last_name,
    ARRAY[user_data.email] AS email_address,
    encrypted_password AS password_digest,
    to_char(user_data.created_at at time zone 'UTC', 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS.US"Z"') AS created_at,
    'bcrypt' AS password_hasher,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] AS phone_number,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] AS web3_wallet,
    NULL AS password,
    CAST(true AS BOOLEAN) AS skip_password_checks,
    CAST(true AS BOOLEAN) AS skip_password_requirement,
    NULL AS totp_secret,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] AS backup_codes,
    '{}'::jsonb AS public_metadata,
    '{}'::jsonb AS private_metadata,
    '{}'::jsonb AS unsafe_metadata
FROM user_data
LEFT JOIN user_profiles ON user_data.id = user_profiles.user_id
"""

# Execute the SQL query
cur.execute(sql_query)

# Fetch the results
results = cur.fetchall()  # Fetching only the first row

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

The SQL query logic works in the following way:

- Get the main `user_data` in one CTE
- Get all the `user_profiles` info from a separate table, e.g. `first_name` and `last_name` in a second CTE.
- Piece all the info together and add any missing parts

<Callout variant={'destructive'} icon={<Icons.alertTriangle />}>
  Make sure to adjust the sql query as needed. E.g. if you have **no username** or other auth types.
</Callout>

The final SQL Select directly corresponds with the needed post body:

```sql
SELECT
    user_data.id::TEXT AS external_id,
    user_data.username,
    user_profiles.first_name,
    user_profiles.last_name,
    ARRAY[user_data.email] AS email_address,
    encrypted_password AS password_digest,
    to_char(user_data.created_at at time zone 'UTC', 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS.US"Z"') AS created_at,
    'bcrypt' AS password_hasher,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] AS phone_number,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] AS web3_wallet,
    NULL AS password,
    CAST(true AS BOOLEAN) AS skip_password_checks,
    CAST(true AS BOOLEAN) AS skip_password_requirement,
    NULL AS totp_secret,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] AS backup_codes,
    '{}'::jsonb AS public_metadata,
    '{}'::jsonb AS private_metadata,
    '{}'::jsonb AS unsafe_metadata
FROM user_data
LEFT JOIN user_profiles ON user_data.id = user_profiles.user_id
```

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/migrate-user-authentication-supabase-clerk-dev/CleanShot-2023-06-07-at-09.33.22@2x.png"
  width={1526}
  height={1520}
  alt={'Clerk Post User Body'}
/>

One of the most awesome things is that we can straight away export the `encrypted_password` to Clerk.dev, since Supabase is using `bcrypt` as mentioned here:

<Image
  className="my-4 rounded-lg"
  src="/posts/migrate-user-authentication-supabase-clerk-dev/CleanShot-2023-06-07-at-09.38.14@2x.png"
  width={2108}
  height={952}
  alt={'Supabase Bcrypt Usage'}
/>

So all we need to do is just specify the following in SQL:

```sql
'bcrypt' AS password_hasher
```

### Connecting to Clerk.dev BackendAPI and creating new users

Finally using the set up environment variable in Step 1, we connect to Backend API and iterate over the rows to create each user in Clerk.dev.

<Callout className="my-4" variant={'destructive'} icon={<Icons.clock />}>
  As specified in the Rate limits section we can only make 20 requests per 10 seconds. That is why I
  included the wait time.
</Callout>

```python
# API endpoint
url = "https://api.clerk.com/v1/users"

# Authorization token (replace with your actual token)
token = f"Bearer {os.environ.get('CLERK_SECRET_KEY')}"

# Headers for the POST request
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": token}

# For rate limiting, if you can do 20 requests per 10 seconds,
# you need to wait 0.5 second between each request
wait_time = 0.5

# Send the POST request
for result in tqdm(results):
    response = requests.post(url, json=result, headers=headers)
    time.sleep(wait_time)  # Wait for a bit to respect the rate limit

    data = response.json()

    if "errors" in data and len(data.get("errors")) > 0:
        if data["errors"][0].get("message") == "That email address is taken. Please try another.":
            print(f"User with email {result.get('email_address')[0]} already exists")
            continue
        else:
            print(data["errors"])
            raise Exception("Error creating user")
    else:
        print(f"User with email {result.get('email_address')[0]} created successfully")
```

<Callout className="my-4" variant={'positive'} icon={<Icons.partyPopper />}>
  Congrats, you successfully migrated Auth from Supabase to Clerk.dev.
</Callout>
